RaiNet Kakeru　■Access No. 12
"Upa Awakens"

J releases his monster program repeatedly.
Kakeru's fighting spirit returns. But he 
knows not the effect nor usage of Upa's 
While outnumbered、 Kakeru notices something. 
The way to awaken Upa... His father had 
said something about it.

【Kakeru's Father】
「Never sink to underhanded techniques. 
True strength is in the cards.」

The way to awaken Upa is to seal the 
entirety of his program into a RaiNet Card、 
producing an attack card.
Since taking Upa out of the computer 
means uninstalling(killing) him、 Kakeru 
knows it's risky. But Operation Awaken 
Upa is a huge success!
Upa's power increases beyond imagination. 
Kakeru's overwhelming technique and Upa's 
awakened power beat J、 but he runs away 
with a moment's chance.
J sends the words "That was fun" to 
Kakeru's chat window、 angering them.
As if nothing happened、 Upa returns to
a cute desktop accessory.

Cyber Dragon saw it all. He looks at how 
they've grown、 pleased.

【Cyber Dragon】
「Persevere、 Kakeru--」

Although J regrettably got away、 Cyber 
Dragon felt that Kakeru and friends had 
grown. What is his true identity...!?
