“Whose girl is that girl?　Tamaru's love story“

Kakeru and friends eliminate crackers again
today. Tamaru meets the no. 1 girl on the 
net. He can't help but notice Ayumi、 who 
gives off an awfully sad aura.
Tamaru makes up his mind to find Ayumi's 
site and is shocked. It's been ravaged by 
trolls. Her password was cracked、 so she 
can't even close the site.
Investigating、 he finds it was a low level 
prank by an unspecified amount of script 
kiddies using a cracking tool available  
Enraged、 Tamaru challenges the kiddies to 
a match. Tamaru disregards Kakeru's 
warnings、 recklessly plunging headfirst. 
As a result、 he suffers danger、 but 
perseveres、 eventually beating the kiddies 
and restoring Ayumi's site.
Tamaru goes to tell her it's safe now.
But traumatized Ayumi is too scared of 
the net to restart her site、 and doesn't 
return his feelings. Tamaru was at a loss 
for words.

But--
People around the world who knew the 
situation send encouraging mails to Ayumi. 
The internet is not just made of malice. 
There is also unconditional kindness.
Ayumi decides to reopen her site. And they 
find out she also attends Kaigyou.
The two of them meet once. Who appears in 
front of the nervously waiting Tamaru is 
a boy. Ayumi was a Guy In Real Life.

And thus、 Tamaru's love(?) splendidly 
was in spite of myself.
