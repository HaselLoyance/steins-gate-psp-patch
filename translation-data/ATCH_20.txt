RaiNet Kakeru　■Access No. 11
"Prince of J、 again"

J starts another cyberterror incident. 
Kakeru chases but is repelled by the enemy.
He and his friends are program frozen by 
the Monster Program "Vaios."
With them in that state、 J talks to Kakeru.

【Ｊ】
「Kakeru、 why do you try to stop me?」

【Kakeru】
「Why are you doing this!? Is suffering 
really that fun for you!?」

J answered he was testing his own power.
To see if he could break the unbreakable、 
steal the unstealable. Testing oneself... 
is that not also why Kakeru is a Net 
Guardian?
Kakeru says that's not true. J leaves
while saying Kakeru's not being honest.
Kakeru begins to waver with J's words、 
wondering why he became a Net Guardian. He 
wanted to make use of his genius knowledge 
and technique handed down by his father.
He didn't gain power to become a Guardian.

【Kakeru】
「Have I been a Guardian just to test my
own power...?」

Kakeru is troubled. Sitting in front of his
computer、 he doubts his own heart.

With Kakeru like that、 J's invasion reaches 
the Japanese Traffic Ministry's main computer. 
Accidents happen all over. While tragic news-
flashes continue、 Kakeru is unable to stand.
One report catches his eye. A father dies.
The surroundings also look familiar.

Awakened、 Kakeru turns to his keyboard.
The war between Kakeru and J begins anew.
