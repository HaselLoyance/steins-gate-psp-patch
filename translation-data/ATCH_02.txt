　I came here to fulfill the noble mission of changing my present.
　(From your perspective、 the future、 I guess.)
　I came here to destroy the dystopia SERN has built、 and once again 
　obtain our freedom.
　I feel very good about this era.  People everywhere are enjoying 
　their freedom.

　But you will all lose that freedom in merely 20 short years.
　Everyone must become aware of this fact.

　What's a tripfag? I'll be one if you tell me what it is.

　So doesn't that make you SERN's underling?
　If SERN has a monopoly on time machines、 then you have to be.
　Therefore、 your objective to destroy SERN's dystopia 
　is a contradiction.

　So what happens to the country?
　I don't think society can collapse in just 20 years.
　Falling into chaos like in the middle east is &c12; srsly &c00; overused 
　in manga and stuff.

　You plan on changing the future all by yourself、 Mr. Titor?
　How arrogant.
　I mean、 if it's peaceful、 who gives a shit about dystopia.
