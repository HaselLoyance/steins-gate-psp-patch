　The Everett Wheeler model is correct.
　Refer to that for more details.

　It seems like everyone has a fixed idea about the concept of time 
　itself.
　It's not like the flow of time is restricted to one-way traffic from 
　past to future.
　To be more accurate、 the law of cause and effect doesn't allow any 
　contradictions. In the case that the effect portion is changed、 the 
　accompanying cause is changed so it doesn't fail.

　That's the reason why there are few people who can recognize the 
　changes in divergence.
　(Divergence being the ratio of divergence of the world line.)

　If you can't recognize the changes in divergence、
　then how can you even quantify it、 huh、 Titor?
　Oh、 I know、 you've got some magical device on board your time 
　machine that measures it for you lololololol 

　Also、 I've been asking you before how SERN went from 
　researching particles to conquering worlds、
　but when will you answer me、 Mr. John? lol

　Every last one of you has done nothing but slander Titor without 
　even a hint of attempting serious discussion、 huh. That's why every 
　last one of you is garbage!

　If you say time doesn't have to flow from past to future、
　then that makes time machines a very familiar device.
　Because that means going from future to past isn't exactly the 
　"reversal" of space time.
　I can agree with some parts of what Titor said.

　By the way、 Titor、 I'd like to ask you to explain SERN's current 
　experiments in more detail.

　Everett Wheeler model = many-worlds interpretation 
　Basically、 that means parallel worlds.

　This Hououin Kyouma faggot's more annoying than Titor.

　You call yourself John Titor and yet you're perfectly fluent in 
　Japanese...
　Writing in English would at least make it seem more realistic.


　In any case、 you can't write in English、 can you?

　If there really is such a thing as time machines、 then there's a 
　favor I'd like to ask of you、 Mr. Titor.
　My mom died last year in the earthquake that hit Shibuya. If I 
　stop my mom from leaving、 then I can undo her death.
　So please、 lend me your time machine!
