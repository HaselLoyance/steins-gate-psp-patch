"Encounter with Bishop、 online bank hacker"

Online banking has become common knowledge.
Wireless transmissions occasionally
transfer billions of currency units.

The current enemy、 "Bishop" is a tough 
opponent、 cracking through mobile net 
while driving to mask his location.
But Kakeru predicts his opponent's 
movements、 one by one、 gradually cornering 
him. In order to close the distance、 
Kakeru and friends don rollerblades、 moving 
to hotspots and public phone lines in town!
With Kakeru's quick technique and precise
strikes、 along with Tamaru's group's team-
work、 they successfully corner Bishop!
Cornered、 Bishop uses his last resort! 
One of the 9 existing phantom Monster 
Programs、 "Terios!"
Its irrational destruction ability instantly 
turns the tables on Kakeru. Using Terios、 
Bishop prepares the finishing blow.
The vile virus approaches!

Checkmate for Kakeru!! --but then、 as if
to protect them、 something flies out of...

...It's the virtual pet Upa that
Kakeru cared for!
Upa takes the hit in Kakeru's place.

Will Upa be safe!?
