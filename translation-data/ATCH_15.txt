"To the trial、 upaupa! Upa's secret"

Upa had taken a direct attack from the
Monster-level virus.
But he was left unscathed. And of all 
things、 he ate the attack itself.
Kakeru successfully countered Bishop with 
Upa's great efforts. Additionally、 he 
got Bishop's Monster Program "Terios."
But he didn't understand. Why could Upa 
eat such a strong Monster-level virus 
program?

Not even Nagaya-san knew. But the mystery
Site Master "Cyber Dragon、" might know.

Cyber Dragon、 who had information about 
every program in existence、 seemed like an 
elder who knew the entire net world.
Kakeru and friends search for Cyber
Dragon's site immediately.

In order to get the URL for Cyber Dragon's
site、 it seems they must clear the online
game called "Cyber Dragon Trial."
It was a typing battle with increasing 
viral attacks、 wearing Kakeru down.
But he keeps going with his friends' 
encouragement. After struggling、 Kakeru 
successfully gets Cyber Dragon's URL. 
They were able to meet him.

As his name suggests、 his form is an elder
dragon. He looks at Upa's program.
And what he understood was that Upa was
also a Monster Program.
Kirari worries Upa is dangerous. But 
Cyber Dragon says a deadly weapon can be
used to protect if the user wills it.
But that also means it would be necessary 
to awaken Upa's inner Monster Program.
But if Kakeru doesn't fully understand、 the
awakened form will be impossible to control. 
Without knowing how to awaken Upa、 Kakeru
and friends leave Cyber Dragon's site.
To conquer vile programs、 Kakeru vows to 
one day find Upa's Monster Program 
activation process--

Before long、 rumors spread around the world
of Kakeru and friends、 the super elementary...
