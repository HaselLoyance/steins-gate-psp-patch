　World lines are like an infinite number of rivers flowing parallel.
　Along the way、 many of them diverge.
　For example、 whether or not you post on this message board has 
　no effect on this world line's divergence.
　But、 if you were to be killed by a random attacker、 then the world 
　line's divergence would change.
　However、 it probably wouldn't change any more than about 
　0.000002%.
　So that nobody misunderstands、 I'd like to add that that means 
　a human is only worth that much.
　That value skyrockets in the face of war、 major acts of terrorism、
　etc.

　Thanks to whoever taught me about tripcodes.
　It will be best for me to use this from now on. I'll remember it.

　I'm a little tired today、 so let's save the rest for another day.
　It's been fun talking to everybody.
