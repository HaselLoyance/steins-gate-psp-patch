　Urban life doesn't exist in 2036 as it does today.
　People raise their own food to eat.
　Commerce is quarantined worldwide、 so people spend most hours 
　of the day on the farm.

　There are still scientific and technological advances、
　but those are rarely offered to the general public.

　Because they're nearly all under the thumb of SERN and SERN's 
　behind the scenes committee.

　It's ostensibly peaceful.
　It's not as brutal as 2010.

　It's not like there isn't any war、 you know?
　How do things turn out in the Middle East quagmire?

　You're dissatisfied even though there's peace. I think SERN's 
　pretty cool、 collides particles and doesn't afraid of anything.

　But this Titor guy ripped off time machine technology from 
　SERN、 didn't he?
　Then he's a criminal.
　No mater how you look at it、 Titor's at fault.
　gb2/future/、 terrorist scum!

　The world's governing body in 2036 is SERN.
　SERN established various regulations on humanity.

　All nations throughout the world (Even America!) have been 
　All armies have been dissolved.

　Would you understand if I said communism was revived、
　bringing the standard of living back to the 18th century?
　Except now、 that social structure works flawlessly.

　Don't you all have doubts about how the system which collapsed 
　in the 20th Century could possibly work on a global scale?
　That is my reason for time traveling here.
　

　Yes、 it might be true that I cannot deny being called a terrorist.
　
　I think of ourselves as the Resistance、 but what we are doing is 
　undeniably terrorism.
　There are people and organizations that take actions like mine.

　More importantly、 I want to hear more about the many-worlds 
　interpretation. In 2036、 it's been proven、 right?
　But just how did they prove it?

　Knew he was a terrorist.
　How many have you murdered? What if some of those victims 
　are my kids?
　I could srsly find the bastards who made the time machine and 
　kill them、 right?

　So、 after all、 you start talking about ideologies like that.
　by any chance、 are you a geezer who did a student rally?
　And then you lost your ability to discern reality from delusions、
　and started spewing nonsense. I get it.

　If SERN's been going crazy with their time machine use、 then 
　wouldn't it be through time machine experiments?

　Doing that would make you no better than Titor.
　If you're prepared to do that、 then go ahead.

　Titor、 I want to ask you,
　but did World War III take place?
　What was your reason for coming to this time in the first place?
　Did you get an IBN 5100?

　Eh、 was John Titor a communist spy by any chance?
　
　That's so out of fashion、 so just quit it.

　Speaking of the IBN 5100、 isn't that an Akiba urban myth now?

　My objective for coming to this time is、 as I've already explained、
　to change the future.
　I'm posting on this bulletin board like this to sound the alarm.
　
　Perhaps it won't have any meaning due to the convergence 
　of world lines.
　But it's okay if it works without anyone noticing.


　&rs> > 312&re
　What's this about World War III?
　Could that also be something you've seen me saying a different 
　world line?

　I would like to talk to you once at our own pace.
　I'll write a reply if you give me your mail address.

　Of course、 if anyone else besides Hououin-san 
　wants to mail me up front、 I'll be waiting.
　Because、 as of now、 I've only been getting hate mail.

　Here's my contact address once more:
　&rs john& titor@ egweb. ne. jp&re
