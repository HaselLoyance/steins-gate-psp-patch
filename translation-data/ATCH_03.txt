　I think I should call my time machine a prototype reverse-
　engineered from SERN technology.
　It's not very efficient.

　Relatively speaking、 in 2036、 the world is almost ruled like a 
　dictatorship.
　The dictatorship asserts complete dominance over the people、
　deciding what they will eat、 where they will live、 and whom they 
　will marry、 with no sense of privacy whatsoever.
　And anybody who dares oppose the dictatorship is slaughtered.
　There are no trials.

　I've only seen it in movies、 but small changes in the past cause 
　huge changes to the future 
　Just by your presence you changed the present、
　so what'll you do if you make unexpected changes to the future?

　Anyway、 if you become a time traveler、 could you go and meet up 
　with your past self?
　What would happen if you did?
