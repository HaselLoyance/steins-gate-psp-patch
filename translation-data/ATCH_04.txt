　You're talking about the so called Grandfather Paradox、 huh.
　That's been disproven.
　This world line has a divergence of 0.571024%
　compared to the world line I came from.
　Killing my father would warp the divergence of the world line.
　It would create the possible world where my father is killed、
　but it's not like it would erase the world where he isn't.

　SERN is a particle physics research institution.
　That hasn't changed in 2036.

　You certainly can meet your past self.
　The mainstream way of thinking in 2036 says that even if you do、
　nothing would happen.
　I、 however、 haven't met my past self.
