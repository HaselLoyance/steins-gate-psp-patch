RaiNet Kakeru　■Access No. 2
"Now to the future! RaiNet Formation!"

Completely engrossed by the talk、 Kirari and Tamaru raise their 
voices.

「Just what sort of person is Kakeru?」

Kakeru was actually one who protects the order of the internet:
A Net Guardian.
Kirari and Tamaru wanted to tell their friends how cool that was.
But Kakeru clearly forbade them due to the risk that he may have 
to fight with the culprit.
At that time、 they received news that the mystery hacker "Beesman" 
had attacked an online game server. Kakeru immediately challenges 
him using Nagaya-san's newly made RaiNet Card and the unique 
Browser Alpha Gate.

The first use of a new RaiNet Card. Even with that handicap、
Kakeru successfully cast his Boot Spell.
Just when Kakeru thought he had easily won against the cracker、 
Beesman、 who had complete control of the game server、 overwrites 
the game program system、 sealing Kakeru deep within the game's 
loop dungeon.
Kakeru is in danger.
At that moment、 somehow Kirari and Tamaru also Server Dive.
They came to save Kakeru!
Furthermore、 these two are well versed in this game.
As game players、 they were in pain、 and couldn't just silently 
watch. The two of them absolutely couldn't forgive the hacker who 
had taken over the server and toyed with the game players、 and 
decided to join forces with Kakeru.
With their magnificent assistance、 and Kakeru's shoot ability、
they successfully defeated Beesman.

And when they did、 suddenly an unknown chat window opens on

It was a signal from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.
「By any chance、 are they here to praise us?」 they thought in
delight、 but...
The police turned to them、 and said--

「You're under arrest!」
