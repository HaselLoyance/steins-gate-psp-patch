　It seems nobody especially felt anything when I said that time 
　does not flow in one direction.
　That is evidence that people are stuck on a fixed idea.
　And、 as far as I see、 not destroying that fixed idea could become 
　a serious issue.
　Somehow or another、 it seems you understand the reason why the 
　dystopia was constructed.


　Whenever a momentous incident occurs that would cause 
　divergence to change、 the past is reconstructed to prevent 
　contradictions、 in accordance to the law of cause and effect.
　For example、 if in this world line、 a certain momentous incident 
　were to occur、 causing a significant change in divergence、 we 
　would be transferred to World Line B.
　In this World Line B、 this online bulletin board、 @channel、
　unfortunately never came into existence.
　In this case、 all of your memories up until now of reading 
　and posting on @channel would disappear、 to be overwritten by 
　memories of you doing something else.

　This is、 in short、 proof that by changing the present、 you change 
　the past.

　I explained SERN's situation yesterday. If you want to supplement 
　that explanation、 then you have no choice but to believe what they 
　say.
　They have already succeeded at the creation of micro-black holes.

　I only wish to quench my intellectual thirst.
　Rather than getting belligerent assuming it's a hoax from the start、
　I would prefer to make a sound decision on whether it's fact or 
　fiction after I've heard what Titor has to say.

　I myself、 the mad scientist、 Hououin Kyouma、 will come in contact 
　with Titor in the near future、 and procure a time machine for 
　myself.

　And then I will be the last one laughing. 
　Suck it、 sleazebags!

　But that's wrong、 you fucking retard.
　That's not reconstructing the world、 you idiot、
　that's altering people's memories.
　In the first place、 who the hell can alter the memories of nearly 
　6.7 billion people?
　Do you even realize how stupid that sounds?

　At least eye don't remember anyone having that sort of alteration 
　capability.
　Anywho、 how does that even fit the many-worlds interpretation?
　Do some more research lol.



　micro black holes (lmao)

　The world is ruined?
　That means I can be a road warrior and ride a mod buggy、 right!?
　Lemme go to the barber's and get a mohawk.
　Where can I buy a spiked shoulder pad?

　I looked at SERN's homepage 
　They've been experimenting since 2009.
　But did they srsly make black holes?

　Are you implying our brains make the world?
　Are you saying that every conscience of every human is a branch 
　coming off some sort of trunk?
　Trying to /thread with some pretentious hippie bullshit?
　That's quite enough. gb2/2036/

　I see、 so you're questioning how I've been designating numbers

　Reconstruction of the world 
　and alteration of people's memories 

　I think they're essentially the same thing、 but why do you seem so 
　intent on saying they're different?

　With a few exceptions、 people who can recognize the change of 
　world lines don't exist.
　Reconstruction is over at the exact point the world line changes.

　What's a road warrior?
