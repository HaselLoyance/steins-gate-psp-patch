RaiNet Kakeru　■Access No. 8
"Echo、 Inazuma! Typing Masters' Secrets!"

Despite the incident、 they safely arrive at 
the LA airport. Exiting the crowded terminal、
they express concern for an American youth 

【Tamaru】
「Heh、 so Americans are fine people too-」

【Kirari】
「Considerate people live in every country.」

30 minutes from airport by bus. They arrive 
at the LA convention center.
An aura of feverish competition spreads
through the Typing Master grounds.
Most surprisingly、 the participant list 
includes world famous hackers and crackers.
Since they leave no evidence、 they evade 
wanted lists.
And within is the name of the fated opponent、 
"J." They have not yet met personally.

【Tamaru】
「I bet he looks like a scoundrel.」

The battles are live-streamed worldwide on 
the internet、 grasping the same attention 
as the Olympics.
The tournament starts the main race. An 
energetic DJ announces the top 8. 7th 
called is Kakeru、 and last is "J's" name.
That last face... is the face of the boy who 
helped the lady in the airport!
The 3 are shocked. Who is he? Also、 Kakeru 
is the last Japanese rep remaining. Another 
one、 Red's subordinate、 lost first round. 
They can only watch over Kakeru.
Kakeru's first best 8 opponent is the 
rhythmic Dancing Typist "Lost Shade、" 
who was no match for Kakeru's speed and 
completely lost.
Kakeru advances. His next opponent is 
"Indra Panther" son of an Arabian oil baron.
Using limber yoga movements、 he appeared 
jointless. It was a hard match since his 
movement patterns left no openings.
But Kakeru used a freezing virus attack、 
sealing his opponent's moves. Finally、 one 
light touch shattered him like ice.

Now it's the finals! As expected、 the 
opponent is that mysterios man “J”.
How will this match turn out....!?
