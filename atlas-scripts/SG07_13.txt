#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
Nighttime already.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
I was given a bed in another room, but I wasn't sleepy, just idly thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
The reason I can't sleep is the pain throughout my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
Not just that──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000023C)
What should I do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024C)
The D-mail that Faris sent to her own father──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
The mail to cancel that──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000026C)
Thoughtlessly, I came in contact with her dad himself, giving birth to unnecessary internal conflict.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000027C)
I'm about to steal a blood relative from Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028C)
Can that be forgiven?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029C)
But if I don't, I can't save Mayuri....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000037A)
I hear a knock, and the door opens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038A)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039A)
I hear Faris' voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AA)
【倫太郎】
Oh, Faris. Still not asleep?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BA)
【フェイリス】
Can I come inside?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CA)
Mm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
The usual Faris would've said Can I come inside nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000430)
Without waiting for my answer, Faris enters the room on her own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000440)
And then she sits on the bed I'm lying on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C0)
Faris didn't have her cat ears on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D0)
【フェイリス】
...Well. Thanks for before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E0)
【フェイリス】
When the Viral gang chased me, I was really scared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F0)
Does she have a fever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000500)
Why is she talking so normally?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
She usually insists Faris is Faris nya, so is she talking to me as Akiha Rumiho now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
This isn't Faris──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000530)
Is what I want to say, but Faris' voice talking normally is really fresh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000540)
I'm somehow excited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000550)
【フェイリス】
That was the first time. That I ever felt such black emotion from that crowd of people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000560)
【倫太郎】
Those guys were obsessed with black after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000570)
And then she lightly strikes my lap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000580)
【フェイリス】
Geez. I was speaking seriously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
Th-this.... Even her retort is normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
The one before me isn't the cat eared maid, nor the RaiNetter champion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B0)
But a normal girl....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
【フェイリス】
Do you wounds hurt?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
【倫太郎】
No, it's fine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma... no, Okabe-san, if you weren't there, I don't know what would happen. I shiver just thinking about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
【倫太郎】
Don't say that again. Just call me what you usually do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000600)
Faris sighs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000610)
【フェイリス】
Anyway, Kyouma, I can't thank you enough. Thank you, honestly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000620)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma, you know... You're my prince.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000630)
Prince...? What's with the fairy tale talk?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000640)
It's giving me goosebumps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000650)
A-at times like these... I can overcome the strange atmosphere as Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000660)
【倫太郎】
I-I am not a prince. I am an insane mad scientist and──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068A)
And, before I can finish, Faris throws her body down this way for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069A)
【倫太郎】
...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AA)
She clings onto me tightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BA)
【倫太郎】
F-Faris...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CA)
【フェイリス】
I want you to call me Rumiho.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DA)
【倫太郎】
No, Faris is Faris, right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
Gh, the atmosphere's getting more and more ticklish...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
What... should I do about this!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
What does Faris want!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
【フェイリス】
Hey... I think we should end this already.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072A)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073A)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma, you went back in time, risking your life to save me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074A)
【フェイリス】
So, I want to grant your wish too, Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075A)
【倫太郎】
But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076A)
I swallow the rest of my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077A)
But granting my wish would mean erasing Faris' dad.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078A)
My heart throbs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087E)
It was like this with Suzuha too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
I erased the Suzuha's memories she made in 2010, and her memories of meeting her father, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
For the sake of my wish-- for the sake of saving Mayuri,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AE)
Must I once again sacrifice something precious to someone else?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000926)
【フェイリス】
It was on my 8th birthday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000936)
She casts her eyes down while clinging to me──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000946)
Faris begins her story.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A0)
【フェイリス】
I wanted Papa to take just that day off work to come play with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B0)
【フェイリス】
Back then, Papa's company wasn't big, so everyday, from morning till night, he would keep working, so I never got to see him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C0)
【フェイリス】
The present I wanted the most was to spend one day with Papa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D0)
【フェイリス】
Papa promised. That he'd spend the day with me no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
【フェイリス】
But──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F0)
【フェイリス】
But after all, pressing business matters happened and he broke the promise the previous day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A00)
【フェイリス】
Do you mean Papa doesn't love me anymore?' I said, extremely anxious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A10)
【フェイリス】
So on my birthday, I ran away from home. I wanted Papa to worry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A30)
Faris cut off her words there, downcast.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A40)
After a while, she lifts her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A50)
Shining spheres run down the corners of her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
【フェイリス】
...On that day, the plane Papa rode messed up its landing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A70)
【フェイリス】
Only one person died. All other passengers were safe, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
Don't tell me──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
【フェイリス】
That person was Papa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA0)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB0)
That was before the world line changed──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC0)
Events from the world line where her dad's dead in 2010──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD0)
【フェイリス】
I couldn't believe it. That the world would push such a cold fate onto me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE0)
【フェイリス】
I don't know you anymore, Papa! You should just die!'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF0)
【フェイリス】
──Those were the last words I had said to him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B00)
【フェイリス】
...I closed my relationship with Papa for all eternity with those words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B10)
Before she noticed, Faris' voice got wet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B20)
【フェイリス】
Even though I loved him... why did I say those last things to him... I always felt guilty for Papa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
【フェイリス】
I always thought. If only I had a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
Did... fate guide her to me then...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B50)
【フェイリス】
That's why, when Kyouma talked about time machines, I thought that was a chance given to me by God or Buddha or Fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B60)
【倫太郎】
Faris... Rumiho. You don't have to say anything more today...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B70)
【フェイリス】
No. Let me talk to the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B80)
Faris wouldn't leave me no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B90)
After sniffing and wiping away her tears, she smiles for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA0)
【フェイリス】
I'm already satisfied. Because just now, Papa came to save me... because I know that he really thinks I'm important to him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB0)
【フェイリス】
I've already enjoyed this reward plenty enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC0)
【フェイリス】
So you need to change the past back to normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
【倫太郎】
But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma, Mayushii's a very important friend to me, you know? If Mayushii's in a crisis, then I would do the same thing you would. Okay, Kyouma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
【倫太郎】
...Sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C00)
【フェイリス】
Didn't I say so? This current reality isn't reality, but a reward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
【フェイリス】
Or maybe I should say a dream. Papa originally doesn't belong in this time. You're just turning this back to normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C20)
【フェイリス】
Thank you for showing me this dream. Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
【倫太郎】
Is this... really okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
【フェイリス】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C50)
Faris buries her face into my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C60)
【フェイリス】
Ugh, actually... it's not okay at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
【フェイリス】
I remembered how things were before the world changed, but──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C80)
【フェイリス】
I also remember everything about how things were after the world changed too, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C90)
【フェイリス】
My memories are in a huge panic now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA0)
【フェイリス】
Before the change and after the change got all mixed up. I don't know which one is real any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB0)
【フェイリス】
But if I say any more selfish things, it'll make Kyouma sad, right...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC0)
【フェイリス】
I don't want to see Kyouma's sad face. I mean, you are my prince, after all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD0)
【倫太郎】
But...! There might be a world where we don't lose your dad and Mayuri doesn't die! If we try searching for it──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE0)
【フェイリス】
It's okay. It's okay now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF0)
【フェイリス】
Because I don't want to run any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D00)
If she says that much, there's nothing I can reply with.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D10)
I tightly embrace Faris' slender body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D20)
【倫太郎】
...Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D30)
【フェイリス】
Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change the past back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D40)
She says so even though she's already crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D50)
I nod silently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D60)
Faris' body trembles with emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D70)
Since her dad's sleeping in the room next door, she probably thought it would be bad if he noticed. So Faris cries, muffling her voice into my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA4)
Now it's already noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB4)
The center of my head feels dizzy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC4)
I feel like I'm out of oil. My body is immobile from fatigue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED4)
The pain in my wound the Viral Attackers inflicted yesterday has calmed considerably, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE4)
But in the end, I still couldn't sleep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
I promised Faris that we'd commence tactics at 12.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F04)
Until then, we wait at Faris' house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F14)
I already contacted Daru and the others back at the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F24)
I told them about the experiment we're going to do today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
【倫太郎】
Faris...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
Just seeing that crying face gives me a sharp pain in my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)
【フェイリス】
I'll go give my last goodbyes to Papa now nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
Oh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD2)
When she equips her cat ears, Faris' usual speaking habits return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE2)
What a handy tool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF2)
【フェイリス】
Let me be alone with Papa for a while nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001012)
Maybe I should've said Wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001022)
Maybe I should've said I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001032)
I said nothing to Faris' back as she went to her father's study.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001062)
When Faris finishes her farewells with her father and comes out of the study, the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s settings are already complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001072)
I got in touch with Daru at the lab, making sure that the 42in Braun tube TV in the workshop is also on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001082)
Now all we have to do is send the D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001092)
But I hesitate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DA)
【フェイリス】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EA)
Instead of looking straight at Faris' red eyes, I look down to my feet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FA)
Eternal separation from her father....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110A)
I wonder what Faris is thinking now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
【フェイリス】
Kyouma, you can't make that face nya-. Kyouma's done nothing wrong nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001134)
【倫太郎】
But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114E)
【フェイリス】
NyanNya~n♪ That talk's already over nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115E)
【倫太郎】
...Okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116E)
If Faris tells me to blow off my worries, then I can't keep this depressed face on for good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117E)
I consciously tighten my face muscles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118E)
Just before leaving the room yesterday, Faris told me the contents of the first D-mail she sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119E)
KidnappedKid Ransom 100MM UseSinkansen
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
The mail stopped her father from riding the airplane.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BE)
As a result, he didn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
And at the same time, the mail slightly changed cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DE)
Her dad needed to sell the IBN 5100 to prepare the ransom money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EE)
And as a result, the IBN 5100 was not dedicated to Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FE)
Faris didn't have to participate in Akihabara's city development conferences in her father's stead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E2)
The result, Faris' attraction, the moe shops, never appeared in Akiba in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F2)
"MayQueen+Nyan²" didn't open either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001302)
Faris wasn't worked to death, so she could enter RaiNet tournaments as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001372)
That is to say, the current Faris enjoyed a normal student life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001382)
Before the past changed, Faris was a student and had also inherited the piled up work from her father, and she worked hard at her part time job as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001392)
Which one is happiness?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A2)
That wasn't for me to decide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B2)
Faris decided it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C2)
Faris decided to return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D2)
I'm helping her close this dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E2)
Faris already inputted the cancellation D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)

#WRITE(PTR, $00001422)
When Faris sends that to her father, it will really be her last words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143C)
【フェイリス】
By the way, if we return the world to normal, will all of Faris' memories now disappear nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144C)
【倫太郎】
...No way that'll happen. You'll surely remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145C)
【倫太郎】
After all, you remember what happened both before and after the past changed now, right?
<END>

Is that why you so desperately saved Faris nya?

...That's, well. Up to your interpretation.

I feel my cheeks unconsciously get warm, so I look down to hide my face.

Faris...

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B6)

Doesn't want to forget her time with Kyouma nya.

...Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EA)
I take Faris' phone.

Sorry, I lied.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158C)
Most likely, if we change the world back,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
All of her memories of this world line will disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
Or perhaps another miracle will happen, and, like this Faris, she will regain her memories of this world line. But I don't know the chances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FE)
It might not even change back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001624)
So──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
I will engrave onto my mind-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
The memories of Faris, the RaiNet Champion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001696)
The memories of her dad, who gave thanks to a stranger like me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BC)
I will engrave them onto my mind.

Kyouma...？

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ECC)
I won't let this end yet.

【倫太郎】
I don't want to let this dream end yet──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEC)
Don't jump to conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFC)
We should explore other various methods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0C)
We shouldn't make hasty decisions about this problem.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1C)
After all, the life of Faris' father hangs in the balance.

Let's try... some other way.

Faris tempted you, nya...

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
【倫太郎】
No, it's okay. This was my decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F96)
I won't become a god after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA6)
I don't think I could stand the burden gods should bear.
