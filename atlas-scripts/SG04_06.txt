No, is the ground shaking?

Am I shaking?

I'm hit by an unseen impact, and my feet stagger.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028E)
I stand still, preparing for another impact as I try to recall this sensation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029E)
I've felt this sensation before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AE)
Tremors as if the world itself is shaking, more intense than when we sent the D-mails yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BE)
That's it, this sensation--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CE)
Is the same as the mass disappearance phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002EE)
The impacts stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FE)
I loosen the tension in my body and observe my surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000030E)
Did the past change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000031E)
No need to ask. I'm sure of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032E)
The past changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033E)
That bizarre sensation is proof of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034E)
I look around the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F0)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp), which should have about 90 seconds left on its timer, is not in operation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000492)
Daru's here. Mayuri's here. Kurisu's here.

#WRITE(PTR, $000004A2)
...Where's Moeka?

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B2)
【倫太郎】
Where's the masseuse? Where'd she go?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000528)
When I ask, Daru and Kurisu, who were discussing something in front of the X68000, look at me dubiously.

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C6)
Ah....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D6)
Again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E6)
This uncomfortable atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F6)
Same as yesterday.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065A)
【紅莉栖】
Misuse?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000674)
【至】
Okarin. Japanese please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
I leave the development room, look around the lounge, behind the sofa, in the dressing room, the bathroom, and the shower room. I look down the window to the street below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
But Moeka's nowhere to be found.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
She disappeared.... She vanished....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
This can't be....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B6)
I desperately convinced myself that that phenomenon was a dream, or a phantom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C6)
The same thing happened again....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D6)
Does this mean Moeka disappeared because I made her experiment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E6)
Why did she disappear!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
What does it mean to disappear!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000806)
Did I undo her entire existence!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000816)
Or did she get blown off into the valley between dimensions!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000826)
I start shivering for fear of my own mistakes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FC)
Confused, Mayuri draws closer while eating a banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
I grab her shoulders and shake her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000926)
【倫太郎】
Where's Kiryuu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn't she!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000936)
【まゆり】
Nn~~ah~~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000946)
【まゆり】
Wh~o~o~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000956)
【倫太郎】
Kiryuu Moeka!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5E)
Daru and Kurisu also ask with their glances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6E)
【至】
Who's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7E)
【紅莉栖】
Never heard of her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8E)
【倫太郎】
...No way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9E)
So I erased Moeka's existence after all....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAE)
Wait, did I really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABE)
I don't want to accept it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACE)
I won't accept the fact that I killed her!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
【紅莉栖】
Okabe, again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF8)
【倫太郎】
What do you mean, 'again'?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B08)
【紅莉栖】
Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn't. Uh, what was it again....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B22)
【紅莉栖】
Oh yeah, 'Reading Steiner'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC0)
I certainly did give that name to this phenomenon-- or, ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
When the past changes the world line, people's memories are reconstructed to match that world line. I just thought of that possibility.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
And if that's true, then how come only my memories continue even in the world line after the past changed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
The answer to that may be the demon eye, Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C00)
Looks like Kurisu remembers the name I gave in yesterday's explanation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
To tell the truth, I only think of that ability as a suitable explanation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C20)
But now that Moeka has disappeared, I now want to believe that the demon eye is real.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
Their memories. Only their memories of Moeka have disappeared!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
Only I remember because of Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C50)
That's definitely it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D30)
Anyway, I need to contact Moeka. I want to make sure I didn't erase her very existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D74)
But I don't know her phone number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB0)
Now, in this world line and at this time, I've only contacted her by mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F60)
I send her a message saying If you see this mail, please reply immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F76)
Now all I can do is wait for her reply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F86)
Please, reply....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCE)
【まゆり】
Okarin, are you okay? Your face is ghastly pale-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDE)
【倫太郎】
Ah, yeah, I've okay....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
My mental state is not okay, but I'm desperately feigning calmness since I don't want to recognize that Moeka's existence disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C2)
【倫太郎】
...Assistant, how much do you remember about the current experiment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D2)
【紅莉栖】
I don't even remember experimenting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
【紅莉栖】
You sent a D-mail just now, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
【倫太郎】
...Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
【倫太郎】
But things are different from yesterday. I didn't send the D-mail. Kiryuu Moeka did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A0)
And the perpetrator disappeared from the room like smoke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B0)
She shouldn't have had time to walk out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C0)
Which reminds me, yesterday, with the LOTO SIX experiment, Daru teleported from the development room to the lounge....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D0)
So I shouldn't think that she disappeared, but rather, she instantly moved somewhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E0)
I hope that's it....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F0)
I couldn't calm down while waiting for Moeka's response, so I check my phone's history for the mails Moeka and I exchanged.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
That's strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
The mails from that mail demon remain up until the one I received on July 31 at 12:43.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
But the mails I received from Moeka after that time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
The dozens of mails I should've received from that woman are nowhere to be found.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
Even the existence of those mails disappered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
The D-mail to cancel the phone model exchange. Its arrival date was July 31.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
A time paradox occurred, and at the same time Moeka received the D-mail, her existence disappeared--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001270)
I shiver once I notice that that line of thought has no contradictions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001280)
No way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001290)
That can't be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A0)
I mean, her D-mail was something as harmless as don't change phone models you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
So then, what's the cause?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C0)
What's the cause for all traces of Moeka these four days after August 1 to disappear...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
【倫太郎】
Christina. Let's say a D-mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133E)
【紅莉栖】
...I don't know. Not a single person has yet experienced a time paradox after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000134E)
【倫太郎】
But before, didn't you say something like the world would disappear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
【紅莉栖】
I only said that that was only a theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001382)
【紅莉栖】
Perhaps nothing happens, and like a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
【紅莉栖】
According to Dr. Hawking's <DICT>chronology protection conjecture</DICT>, it's impossible to do things that can possibly cause time paradoxes in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
So is everything just a hypothesis....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147E)
【まゆり】
You know, Mayushii doesn't get it-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001498)
【まゆり】
Since Mayushii and Okarin and everyone can talk like this, I think that paradox hasn't happened-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
【まゆり】
Mayushii doesn't know that Moeka-san person, but I'm sure she's okay too♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014FA)
【至】
That's Mayushii for you. A cute dumb girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001514)
【まゆり】
Ehh-? Mayushii's not a dumb girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
Right now, I hate how Mayuri and Daru can have such a carefree conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C2)
They don't realize the gravity of the situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DE)
Even though a person's existence may have disappeared from the world...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EE)
In fact, if Moeka really did vanish, then at the same time, that means that our creation, the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is also responsible for that mass disappearance phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FE)
I blew out the existences of that many humans--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160E)
I didn't want to think such frightening things, so I desperately shake my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001704)
【倫太郎】
...！
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001722)
A mail! From Moeka!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
I check the mail with hope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
【倫太郎】
...Ha, haha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F8)
My body goes limp from the relief....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001908)
Her reply came. It came.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001918)
Moeka still exists in this world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001928)
She didn't disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193E)
Knowing that made my impatience, my tension, and my fears all wash away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194E)
I'm moved to tears. Not because I was worried for Moeka, but because I had avoided the fearful situation of being responsible for erasing someone's existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AA)
【紅莉栖】
Explain what happened, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A12)
Urged by Kurisu, I explain everything that just happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB4)
【紅莉栖】
Hmmm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACE)
【紅莉栖】
...I don't think it's unnatural for Kiryuu Whatsherface-san to have disappeared from this place if you consider the law of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADE)
【倫太郎】
What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEE)
【紅莉栖】
I don't know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryuu-san's actions these past four days since July 31 changed ever so slightly this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFE)
【紅莉栖】
As a result, circumstances were reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn't come to the lab...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0E)
So that's why it looked like she teleported?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1E)
It looks like the phenomenon with gel-banas, but it's not, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2E)
Moeka didn't become a Jellyman after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B48)
【至】
Is that even possible?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
【紅莉栖】
I didn't say that. If the fact that the D-mail was sent is erased, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-mail....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7C)
【紅莉栖】
And there's one other thing that happened to Okabe that I don't understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
【倫太郎】
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
【紅莉栖】
Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC0)
【紅莉栖】
By the way, you should quit with that coinage since it's embarrassing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD0)
【倫太郎】
Hmph, I didn't ask for your opinion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE0)
I'm finally able to joke again with her again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF0)
Well, maybe Kurisu wasn't joking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C00)
But it's none of her business.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1A)
【紅莉栖】
With your explanation, you weren't the one to receive the D-mail either. Yet how come only you remember what happened before the world line changed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C34)
【紅莉栖】
But, isn't this just your delusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)

A brain waifu. I understand.

No you don't. Don't lump me into your ＨＥＮＴＡＩ gentleman club.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【紅莉栖】
This Kiryuu-san didn't exist in the first place. Or possibly, Kiryuu Whatsherface-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-mail was a delusion--

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA2)

I hold down my left eye and crouch on the spot.

Ugh, ggh... my left eye, this demon eye, Reading Steiner, aches...!

O-Okarin, are you okay...?

Mayuri peeks anxiously at my face. But I lightly push her aside.

No, Mayuri, d-don't come close.... Right now, I might end up... hurting you...!

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB8)
I grind my teeth while on all fours.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC8)
And then I take a deep breath, gradually removing my hand from my left eye.

Mayuri rubs my back.
