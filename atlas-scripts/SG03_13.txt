I want to get in touch with Titor soon.

ヤツならば俺の求める答えを示してくれるかもしれないのだ。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000250)
あるいは、数日前に俺だけが目撃した出来事├┤アキバの路上からすべての人が一瞬で消失したあの体験├┤も、これで説明が付く可能性すらある。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000434)
というわけで急いでラボ内に戻ると、みんなの心配そうな目が一斉に俺に集中した。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000550)
まゆりが真っ先に慰め（？）の声をかけてこようとするのを、俺は手を上げて制する。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
【倫太郎】
Wait! We'll talk when everything's over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
I explain that we can't keep experimenting since the Braun Tube Workshop manager came back. Then I dismiss everyone for today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082E)
【まゆり】
Okarin, you know, I'll buy you a banana tomorrow, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
She says that and hands me the Upa plush toy placed on the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000980)
【まゆり】
So for now, hug this little guy su-per tight and cheer up, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
It looks like she's fussing over me. But Mayuri shouldn't worry about me. -She- worries -me-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
She has to work after this, so she leaves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
Daru goes with her. He probably wants to go meet Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
Lukako keeps apologizing to me. Looks like he regrets messing up the LOTO SIX ticket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
That reminds me, Lukako found out about the time machine too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD8)
Next time, I'll make him a lab mem to silence him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF4)
Moeka nods and goes home without a word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
In less than 30 minutes, Kurisu and I are the only ones left in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9E)
【倫太郎】
Assistant over there. You not going home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAE)
【紅莉栖】
If I'm an eyesore, I'll leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBE)
【倫太郎】
You're not an eyesore at all. But do you have any business here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCE)
【紅莉栖】
No. But there's something I want to think about for a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDE)
【倫太郎】
Then go back to your hotel and think about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF8)
【紅莉栖】
What? You want to kick me out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
【倫太郎】
Oh, I see, since you have no friends, you'd be sad and lonely in your hotel room, so you want me, Hououin Kyouma, to look after you, huh, you damn spoiled celeb sev?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
【紅莉栖】
You're the lonely one, aren't you? You've been depressed for a while now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
【紅莉栖】
Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider in a sense, so shouldn't it be easy to talk to me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C42)
【紅莉栖】
A man getting advice from a younger woman is... mmhmm mmhmm, but if you're fine with that, then just ask away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
Does she have to be this impertinent?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C62)
She's smiling happily as if to make fun of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C72)
【倫太郎】
I need to send some mails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way, okay, the Zombie?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8C)
【紅莉栖】
You just have to call me that, don't you....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAE)
Even though she says that, Kurisu still doesn't go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBE)
She sits down on the sofa, beginning to read a massive technical book. On closer inspection, it's a western book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCE)
Maybe this assistant isn't a genius, but just an extreme studier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDE)
【倫太郎】
Want some coffee?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D26)
【紅莉栖】
Sure thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC6)
I heat up the instant coffee for Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3C)
I take out a fresh Dr Pepper out of the refrigerator for myself and sit down in front of the computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
Alright, let's do what I should do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED2)
For now, let's pray that I -can- do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
What I should do is follow Suzuha's advice from earlier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0E)
Get in touch with Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
Because what I'm experiencing right now could possibly be the many-world's interpretation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
Which would mean that Kurisu over there and the Kurisu from before aren't one in the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
This lab is a different lab from the lab before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F86)
I don't quite understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
【紅莉栖】
What are you pacing for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108E)
Kurisu looks at me with her cold glare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
Dammit. Those eyes are clearly eyes ＨＥＮＴＡＩ-discerning eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CA)
I'm told her I'm not a ＨＥＮＴＡＩ, but Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
Why am I the only one who remembers in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
That's another question I'll ask of John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001192)
I can't prove if he's a real time traveler or not, but there's that thing about the IBN 5100, so I believe he's real in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
But, what sort of mail should I send?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124C)
I guess I have no choice but to say tell it like it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125C)
In any case, nothing will happen if I just worry about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001286)
Half rebuking myself, I stop stalling and take out my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
I silently sigh and chug down my Dr Pepper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
Now I just wait for his reply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
I try looking at the @channel thread just to make sure, but it looks like Titor isn't posting now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166E)
【紅莉栖】
That was a pretty deep sigh, wasn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
Kurisu asks without raising her glance from her book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B6)
Maybe I should talk to Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C6)
About how sending the D-mail changed the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D6)
And about how Kurisu completely lost her memories about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E6)
Why am I only thinking of talking to Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F6)
Because I don't think Mayuri or Daru understand this problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001806)
Kurisu on the other hand, might be able to form some sort of hypothesis. That's what I hope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001944)
And then, my phone sounds its ringtone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
Could it be a reply from Titor?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001980)
Not by mail, but directly!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
Startled, I timidly look at my phone's display.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BC)
Daru's name is displayed there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DA)
Disappointed, I lightly click my tongue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F8)
Don't confuse me like that....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE4)
【倫太郎】
Christina. There's something I want to talk to you about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0C)
【紅莉栖】
Shouldn't you answer your phone before that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2A)
【倫太郎】
It's Daru. It's probably something stupid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B48)
Just a while ago, Daru said he was going to MayQueen with a stupid grin on his face, so there's no way he'd suddenly call me for something serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D62)
【紅莉栖】
You're really self-righteous, you know.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D72)
【倫太郎】
You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8C)
【紅莉栖】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9C)
Kurisu stares at my face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAC)
Her expression was more stern than usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBC)
【紅莉栖】
...I haven't been with you long enough to tell whether you're joking or you're serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCC)
【倫太郎】
But it's the truth. And then every human except for me 'forgot' about it. No, to be more accurate, 'that truth vanished.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
【紅莉栖】
The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you're saying is bullshit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
【倫太郎】
What makes you so sure?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E10)
【紅莉栖】
Why do you remember the fact that the past changed, Okabe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E20)
【紅莉栖】
If you said you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that would still just barely explain it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E30)
【紅莉栖】
But with a D-mail, you haven't taken one step outside the 'present', have you?'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
【紅莉栖】
So if the 'present' changed, changing us, then it's a contradiction for you to remain unchanged.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5A)
【紅莉栖】
Or are you saying you didn't change because you're the observer? In that case, this is what you're claiming: 'I am not a human being.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E6A)
I do agree with what Kurisu's saying. And I don't have the means to convince her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E7A)
That's the reason for my confusion, and why I'm mailing Titor now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E8A)
【倫太郎】
...Everything is Steins;Gate's choice, according to the ability of my demon eye, Reading Steiner! Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA4)
【紅莉栖】
Aaaand, he's at it again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F46)
Stunned, Kurisu goes back to her book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F56)
【紅莉栖】
I'm not playing along with your games. Anyhow, that Reading Whatever name... you just came up with it now, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F66)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F76)
The punch line is that Kurisu laughed scornfully, making assumptions with just the current information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
There's still not enough information, even for a mad scientist like me, to explain the phenomenon I experienced earlier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F96)
I bite down on my lips in impatience.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FE)
【倫太郎】
Hello?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000211A)
【至】
Ah, Okarin! Actually, I just noticed an unthinkable mistake!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002136)
【倫太郎】
Mistake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
Is it about the Microwave Ophone (Temp)?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
Is it related to the phenomenon I experienced earlier?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021FC)
I take a deep gulp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000220C)
I, a mad scientist, am getting stressed over a miserable thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000221C)
What is Daru trying to say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222C)
Is it related to the D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002298)
I gently lick my wet lips, waiting for Daru's words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B4)
【至】
Actually...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)
【至】
I left my wallet at the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E0)
【倫太郎】
...Wh...at?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
【至】
So I can't get into MayQueen! Okarin, sorry, but could you bring me my wallet? I'll get you a drink at MayQueen in return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002324)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002334)
【倫太郎】
Go take a swim in Shindengawa!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234A)
I cry out and hang up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000235A)
Dammit, I got stressed over nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002434)
But right afterward, my ringtone resounds again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002452)
【倫太郎】
Tch, damn persistent little...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002470)
There's only about a three minute walk from between the lab and MayQueen, so if it's just a wallet, come get it yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002740)
【倫太郎】
Hello. I'm not delivering your wallet, okay...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002766)
【まゆり】
Tutturu-♪ Okarin, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002782)
【倫太郎】
...Oh, it's you, Mayuri. You're with Daru, right? You don't have to lend that dummy any money, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A8)
【まゆり】
Ah-, yup, okay-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027C2)
【まゆり】
So, Okarin, I was wondering if you cheered up-. Did you make sure to squeeze Upa?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DE)
【倫太郎】
I didn't. Anyway, I am a mad scientist, always full of madness and ambition!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002804)
【まゆり】
I see-. You know, if you're worried about anything, talk to Mayushii, okay-? Mayushii doesn't understand hard things, but she does understand Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002814)
【まゆり】
...You understand me, you say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002830)
【倫太郎】
I do-. We've been together since childhood after all. Ehhehe-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002856)
【まゆり】
...Hmph. I'm hanging up now. Work hard now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002872)
【倫太郎】
Yup. Thanks-. By now-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288E)
【まゆり】
...Geez, that dummy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002912)
【倫太郎】
Okabe. You're grinning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E8)
【紅莉栖】
...!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F8)
【倫太郎】
Wh-what are you trying to say, you celeb sev!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A08)
【倫太郎】
「な、なにを言うか、このセレセブが！」
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A22)
【紅莉栖】
Don't call me celeb sev!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A32)
I thought about talking to Kurisu about the truth, but I quit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A42)
Like hell this mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, would grin at the words of a hostage like Mayuri.
