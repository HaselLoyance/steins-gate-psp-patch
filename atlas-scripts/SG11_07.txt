これにより、中の赤い蛍光塗料が発光を始める。

効果時間はおよそ１０分。紅莉栖が現れる前には発光はおさまっているはず。

自分がすべきことは、はっきりと見えている。

【倫太郎】
What are you so afraid of, Hououin Kyouma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD8)
【倫太郎】
Everything's obviously going as I expected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE8)
I talk to myself as if giving instructions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF8)
【倫太郎】
Operation Norn of the Future"Skuld" is flawless. After all, I spent fifteen years perfecting this plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
【倫太郎】
I believe in myself. I believe in Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D18)
And I will definitely save Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
I lay in wait in the same cardboard boxes as last time, close my eyes, and wait for that time to come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
I hear the sparse sound of applause from the event hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
Meaning I should be hearing footsteps soon──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA0)
And, just as I thought, I see Kurisu with the same timing as when I waited last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
Leaning against the wall, she checks the contents of the envelope and faintly smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
Now I understand why Kurisu is smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9E)
The Upa inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAE)
She's probably smiling at how adorable it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBE)
It really doesn't suit you, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCE)
I smile bitterly inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDE)
My heart is calm even though I've already reached this point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
Nakabachi's appearance is my signal to start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFE)
When he takes out his knife, I'll throw out the Cyalume Saber.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100E)
Then I scare Nakabachi away and stun Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
I can do both by brandishing the stun gun I prepared beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
That was my plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001142)
The next set of footsteps resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001152)
Kurisu raises her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001162)
I can't confirm it, but it's no doubt Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
【紅莉栖】
...I have something to talk about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【中鉢】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
【紅莉栖】
Are you listening? Papa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Every single word Kurisu mutters is the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
【中鉢】
What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000126A)
【紅莉栖】
Papa, I heard you were going to hold a time machine presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【紅莉栖】
So I thought about it too. About whether or not a time machine could be made.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
A disquieting air drifts between the two of them. Nakabachi doesn't even try to hide his displeasure at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
Without a doubt, that's partly because of the complaint the first me rose during the presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
It's just about time for Nakabachi to lose his temper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
Once again, I check the Cyalume Saber in my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001358)
The glow has already dimmed. If I remove the cap at the tip, the fake blood will flow──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BC)
【倫太郎】
...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
I almost stop breathing unintentionally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
I bring the dim Cyalume Saber to my eyes to check in detail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
The fake blood inside had begun to harden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
Strange. This shouldn't be happening. I was certain it should keep fluid for at least 30 minutes after the light goes out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D2)
A dud!? Defective!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
That reminds me, we haven't actually used the Cyalume Saber even once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
The chemicals inside are single use, so it's a consumable item. Considering the lab's financial condition, we never used it, thinking it would be a waste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150E)
It's such a disgrace to notice now of all times!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151E)
And I didn't even bring a spare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152E)
Guh. Not as planned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
The simulated scene in my head crumbles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
【中鉢】
I wasn't exiled!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
I'm startled at Nakabachi's angry yell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
【中鉢】
Those incompetent colleagues of mine were just jealous of my superiority. They were disgusted of me and just gave up on me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001684)
【紅莉栖】
Please don't yell...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001722)
Time won't stop for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001732)
How do I recover from the situation now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001742)
It's impossible to leave this place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
In just a short while, Nakabachi will attack his own daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
If I come out after that, the result will just be the same as last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
I'll end up killing Kurisu again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
That must be avoided at all costs...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
But then, just what should I do!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
Go back to the time machine and start again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
No, that's no good. Suzuha already told me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
There's not enough fuel to leap through time again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
This is my last chance!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001840)
【紅莉栖】
Hey. It's been so long since we last met, so there's a lot I want to talk about, but Papa, you're living in Aomori now, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185A)
【中鉢】
Go back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001874)
【紅莉栖】
Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001884)
【中鉢】
Just go back to America already. I don't want to see your face again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001894)
【紅莉栖】
But──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AE)
【中鉢】
What do you mean you want to hear my opinion!? What do you mean joint signatures! That isn't what you think in the slightest, is it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194C)
I don't know if it's because I'm in a rush, but sweat won't stop running down my brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195C)
My heart keeps beating like it does after exercise, and my breathing gets rough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196C)
I cover my mouth with my hand to supress the sound of my breathing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D0)
【中鉢】
Are you pitying me!? Do you despise me!? Even though you're my daughter!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EA)
【紅莉栖】
Wh-what are you talking about? Calm down──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FA)
【中鉢】
I'm perfectly calm! Don't tell me what to do!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A98)
Nakabachi won't stop heating up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA8)
The same words. The same development.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB8)
Heading straight towards tragedy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC8)
Time, please stop....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD8)
I beg but quickly stop.

Did you forget?

I'll tell you why I called you here today. I triumphed! I was going to flaunt the greatness of my research!

【紅莉栖】
I didn't laugh at──
<END>

Do you want my opinion on this thesis? I'll tell you right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【中鉢】
I will publish this thesis with my name. That is all.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
Forget about the cruel god, forget about the will of the world.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB8)
I will save Kurisu myself.

You're stealing... my thesis? That was the last thing I thought you'd do──

It's finally started...!

Nakabachi puts his hand to Kurisu's neck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002234)
Kurisu's groans of agony reach my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
There's still a way to prevent Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
The puddle of blood I once saw spreading underneath Kurisu's collapsed face down body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002264)
There's still one more way to reproduce that besides using fake blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002274)
That's──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002284)
A bet, to use the world's convergence against itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002294)
But I don't know the odds of winning this bet, and arriving at the unknown world line, the Steins Gate.

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A4)
【紅莉栖】
Ah, uuh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B4)

You think you understand how I feel!? Why do you think you're so superior!? I detest you...! I hate your very existence!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)

Nobody in this world is superior to me! Understand!? It's a disgrace! There's no reason for a daughter to be superior to her father!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
【中鉢】
So I stayed away from you! I couldn't stand the thought of you being my daughter!

Stop!

#WRITE(PTR, $00002354)
I slowly step forward from my covering.

Nakabachi turns to my direction, stunned.

Glimmering, bloodshot eyes.

I won't... let you brats... have your way...!

Nakabachi takes the knife out of his pocket with bloodshot eyes.

And finally, the one who will crush your ambition!

Kurisu gets up on wobbling legs while holding her neck.

Run away...

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DE)

I turn to Nakabachi with both arms spread, not even looking at Kurisu.

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B4)
【倫太郎】
What's wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Can't walk the walk? Not going to kill me?
<END>

But then again, killing someone with such divine strength as mine is probably impossible for the likes of you, huh!? Fuhahaha!

D-don't you mess with me!

No..., Papa, stop it
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028EC)
At this rate, the one who will get stabbed to death is me.

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FC)
Nakabachi's expression is no longer normal.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
He's fallen into insanity. He's being controlled by his warped heart.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291C)
He can't be stopped.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292C)
In that case, that impulse──

I'll take it.

You too, little girlie... I'll massacre everyone...!

Don't move!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F88)
Kurisu rushes over to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
She clings to my body, supporting it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA8)
【紅莉栖】
Lie down! I'll call an ambulance right now...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307A)
I just said massacre everyone so why is this woman running towards me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000308A)
She's good-natured even though she's a tsundere. Back when I was trying to save Mayuri, she was always the one who would support me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000309A)
【倫太郎】
I'll... save you.
<END>

Eh? What do──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003248)
【紅莉栖】
────
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003258)
Kurisu's body convulses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003268)
Strength leaves the legs that had supported me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003278)
She collapses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033CA)
I'm sorry for doing this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033DA)
I apologize in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003488)
【倫太郎】
I'll... torture your daughter as I please... after I kill you...
<END>

【倫太郎】
Nakabachi... first... is you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A8)
【倫太郎】
Heh, heh, heh hahahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034B8)
【中鉢】
Hiiiii!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000356A)
And then Nakabachi throws away his knife with a pitiful cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357A)
He retreats back one step. Two steps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003604)
【中鉢】
Hyeehhhhhh!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003614)
For the finishing touch, I push the switch on the stun gun once more, and finally, Nakabachi turns away. He runs towards the elevator deep in the passage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003624)
But he makes sure to pick up the envelope Kurisu dropped. The shrewd man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003634)
【倫太郎】
Haah... haah... haah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003644)
I try touching my stomach wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C8)
【倫太郎】
Ugg...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D8)
Just with that, pain penetrates my whole body, and I fall on my knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E8)
My consciousnesss is flying away from the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F8)
The blood won't stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003708)
It keeps dripping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003718)
I kneel, and place both hands on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003728)
【倫太郎】
Still not enough...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003738)
I stick my own fingers into my wound wet with blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003748)
I take a small breath and just take the plunge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003758)
【倫太郎】
──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003768)
A terrible pain runs through it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003778)
I can't bear it──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D2)
【倫太郎】
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH────！
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E2)
I scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386C)
I'm seriously going to faint...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387C)
But I still keep opening my wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F2)
【倫太郎】
Gahch, haah, haah, gguh, kha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003902)
The ground is stained more and more red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E6)
【鈴羽】
Uncle Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A02)
Suzuha rushes here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A4A)
【鈴羽】
Th-that wound...! What happened!? Just what happened!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A64)
【鈴羽】
Dummy, of all things... to fail...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A74)
【倫太郎】
Heh, hehe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
【鈴羽】
Uncle...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【倫太郎】
What are you misunderstanding, Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【倫太郎】
Look at this floor... notice anything...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【鈴羽】
Floor...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【倫太郎】
Heh, heh... that's plenty of blood... don't you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADE)
The thing I made there. It's──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF8)
【鈴羽】
Ah...! A puddle of blood...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B08)
For the sake of deceiving the first me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B18)
For the sake of deceiving the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B28)
The stage is set...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B42)
【鈴羽】
But at this rate, you'll die, Uncle...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B52)
【倫太郎】
Kuku, there's no way I'm going to die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B62)
【倫太郎】
Who the hell do you think I am?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B72)
【倫太郎】
I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, you know...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B82)
【鈴羽】
Uncle...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B92)
I was stabbed in Kurisu's place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA2)
I made a puddle of blood on the floor with my blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BB2)
If the world converges, then it's already predetermined that I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC2)
The world desires not my death. My death is in 2025. That's fixed in this β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD2)
That's my wager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BE2)
I dared to provoke Nakabachi, and got stabbed on purpose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF2)
I didn't think it would hurt this much though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C02)
If we reach the Steins Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C12)
That's an unknown world line, with a completely undetermined future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C22)
Of course, that includes the part where I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C32)
How ironic. Even though it means I could die, I want to reach that world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C42)
My lips silently warp into a smile, and I complete the finishing touches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C52)
【倫太郎】
Suzuha... get Kurisu's body...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C6C)
【鈴羽】
Ah, okay...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C88)
Suzuha lifts up Kurisu's body, which had fainted after one blast from the stun gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C98)
Then she lays her face down on top of my puddle of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D06)
Kurisu doesn't wake up. Unconscious, she stays perfectly still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D16)
But she's definitely breathing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D84)
I gently stroke her hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D94)
【倫太郎】
Did it hurt...? I'm sorry. But I did it... to save you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DA4)
【倫太郎】
Because... even though those three weeks... those days won't come back...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB4)
【倫太郎】
I wanted you to live...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DC4)
Even if we reach the Steins Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD4)
Even if Kurisu lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE4)
Even if I don't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF4)
We will probably never meet again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E04)
Kurisu will go to a future where she doesn't become a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E14)
A future where we don't make the Time Leap Machine together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E24)
But, I'm still glad I was able to save her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E92)
【倫太郎】
...farewell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA2)
Please stay unconscious here for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB2)
If you don't, then we can't deceive the first me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC2)
I motion for Suzuha to pick up the knife, and I get up from blocking the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ED2)
【倫太郎】
Mission complete.... Let's head back now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B4)
【鈴羽】
Uncle, this is too absurd.... There's a limit to foolishness!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C4)
【倫太郎】
...foolishness, how rude. Everything went just as planned... hehheh... heh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D4)
【鈴羽】
Don't talk. We'll return right now. To August 21.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E4)
【鈴羽】
Try to bear the G force okay? Ah, damn. We should at least do some first aid, but I didn't bring anything with me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F4)
Pressure almost crushing my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004104)
My wound throbs. I'm about to groan, but I bite my lip and bear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F6)
Rainbow lights fill my vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004306)
The time machine seems to come alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004316)
Suzuha wraps my wound with a towel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004326)
【鈴羽】
Hey, Uncle. I'm sure that the Steins Gate waits on the other side. A world unknown to me, you, or anyone waits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004336)
【鈴羽】
You live, and Makise Kurisu lives, and Shiina Mayuri lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004346)
【鈴羽】
I don't time travel to 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004356)
【鈴羽】
Though I don't know if World War III breaks out or not in this world line...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004366)
【鈴羽】
Though I don't know if SERN's dystopia is constructed or not in this world line...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004376)
Someone's warm hand holds mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004386)
Tightly. Tightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004396)
【鈴羽】
The world we believed in, where the future is filled with hope, is waiting...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044A0)
I softly close my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B0)
Breathing is painful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044C0)
My pain slowly goes away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004524)
【鈴羽】
Once we reach there, I'll most likely disappear. I won't be able to thank you for our arrival at the 'Steins Gate.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004534)
【鈴羽】
So I'll thank you here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004544)
The feeling of her grasping hand gradually fades.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000460A)
【鈴羽】
Thank you, Uncle. ...Don't die. Live.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000461A)
