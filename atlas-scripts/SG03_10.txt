Can you prove it's a delusion?

If it's not a time machine, then it can't change the past. You could prove that, so why are you against it?

Oh shut up...

I won't whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without the fear of the muscular manager downstairs. If we had money, we could maintain our Future Gadget creation funds.

Ahh, LOTO SIX might be just perfect. I'm pretty sure they announce winning numbers every week.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B2)
Promptly searching on the net, we find out hat LOTO SIX announces winning numbers every Thursday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
They've also uploaded last week's 1st through 7th place numbers on the homepage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
【まゆり】
Are you going to send this winning number in a D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
【倫太郎】
Exactly. Though, of course, we have to mention it's a winning LOTO SIX number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
【至】
Hmm, last week's 1st prize was... woah, 200 million!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003718)
What, 200 million!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003728)
That was more money than I had expected, so my heart skipped a beat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003738)
【倫太郎】
N-no, wait! 1st is too much....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003748)
【至】
Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003758)
【紅莉栖】
200 million... that really is surprising, isn't it? hahahah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003768)
【倫太郎】
No, not that. 1st would be... too conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003778)
【紅莉栖】
Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003788)
【倫太郎】
Don't you get it!? I'm being chased by the 'Organization', you know. If we won 1st prize in the LOTO SIX, the media would cover the event, and then and there, our presence will be known.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003798)
【紅莉栖】
It won't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A8)
【まゆり】
Then, why not just have Mayushii win-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B8)
【倫太郎】
No good. Stage 2 of Operation Norn of the Past"Urd"'s does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev over there said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C8)
【紅莉栖】
Celeb Sev... don't abbreviate it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D8)
【倫太郎】
In order to take responsibility, I'll be winner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E8)
【紅莉栖】
You're not just going to take all the money for yourself, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037F8)
I ignore Celeb Sev's straight man act.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003808)
The prospect of hogging 200 million yen certainly is appetizing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003818)
That amount of money is too big a change to the past. Just like Celeb Sev said just now, we can't ignore the Butterfly Effect. We should flap our butterfly wings as small as possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003828)
I-I'm not nervous at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384E)
【倫太郎】
With that said, we'd be too conspicuous, so let's try aiming for 2nd prize. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
【至】
Umm, last time the dividend was... 23 million yen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386E)
【倫太郎】
...l-let's try aiming for 3d prize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387E)
【至】
That decreases it to 700, 000 yen, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000388E)
【倫太郎】
Ah, yeah, that's good. That should be about right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000389E)
【紅莉栖】
So Okabe's a chicken, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038AE)
【倫太郎】
Heh, heheheh...! That's not something you should say after worrying so much about the risk of time paradoxes, dontcha think, Celeb Sev!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038BE)
【紅莉栖】
I'm begging you, please stop calling me that.... I'll settle for Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
【紅莉栖】
Besides, I don't get your line of thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
【倫太郎】
You're considering risks, and deciding if it's too much or too little money. You're the stubborn one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
【紅莉栖】
...How's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FE)
I let Celeb Sev talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000390E)
【まゆり】
Uhmmm, with 700, 000 yen, could we fill a truckload of bananas-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000391E)
She didn't say anything about using the entire dividend on bananas, but it looks like Mayuri intends to do so. Let's ignore the glutton for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000392E)
【至】
For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000393E)
Last week's six winning numbers are 02 12 19 34 35 and 40. The bonus number is 08.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000394E)
1st prize is matching all 6 numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000395E)
2nd prize is matching 5 numbers plus the bonus number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000396E)
3rd prize is matching only 5 numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000397E)
【倫太郎】
Moeka. I assign to you your first duty as a new lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A6E)
【萌郁】
Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A7E)
Moeka stares in wonder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
Seems she didn't expect her name to be called.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【倫太郎】
Think of what to send in the D-mail. Think of something that would convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【萌郁】
Me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【倫太郎】
You are the mail demon, so this should be your strong point, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AD8)
【萌郁】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF2)
She doesn't seem that interested, but Moeka nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B88)
We set the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B98)
We register the forwarding mail address into the X68000 attached to the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA8)
That address is my phone's, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF0)
【紅莉栖】
Thursday last week, so about five days ago, right? Sending your D-mail there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C00)
Putting on the white coat, Kurisu double checks the dedicated phone attached to the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C48)
【至】
The drawing was five days ago, so we have to send it to before then, don't we?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C62)
【紅莉栖】
In that case, one week ago, huh? 7 days is 168 hours, so let's round a bit and set it to 170#.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CAA)
【まゆり】
Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF2)
Moeka finished writing the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D02)
She already punched in the text on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DAC)
<LINE>
%LC"021219343537"<LINE>"Buy LOTO SIX"<LINE>"sure to win!"

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD4)
For the number, we replaced the 40 with 37.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE4)
This way, we should eliminate the possibility of 1st and 2nd prize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF4)
【倫太郎】
Well, this should be it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E04)
We know that we can only send 36 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8C)
【まゆり】
This kinda looks suspicious, doesn't it- Ehheheh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA6)
【萌郁】
...I'll redo it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB6)
I hurriedly stop Moeka from erasing the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC6)
【倫太郎】
This is fine. I don't think there's any other way. Though, it certainly is suspicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EE0)
【まゆり】
It'll be fine-. Actually, Okarin loves suspicious things, so I think it's perfect-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EF0)
That's not entirely incorrect, but it feels like she's making fun of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0C)
Preparations complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1C)
We're sending a mail across space-time, but preparing for that is surprisingly simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2C)
【倫太郎】
Now... it's time to open Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F74)
【紅莉栖】
It's been bugging me, but what is that stain's gait thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FBC)
【まゆり】
It's Okarin's catch phrase-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FCC)
【倫太郎】
Steins;Gate is Steins;Gate. Nothing more, nothing less.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FE6)
【紅莉栖】
That doesn't explain anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FF6)
【倫太郎】
Don't complain about every single thing. That's not what we should be thinking about now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004070)
I place my finger on my phone's send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004080)
I desperately try to stop that finger from trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C8)
【至】
Welp, starting up the microwave-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D8)
I gulp down my saliva.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000413E)
The turntable begins to revolve in the microwave without a door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000414E)
With a thunderous roar, discharge begins to fire off into empty space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000415E)
The timer ticks down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000416E)
163... 162... 161...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000417E)
Change the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000418E)
It seems very simple to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000419E)
But just like Kurisu said, our foundation might collapse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041AE)
I said I'd take responsibility. But that was just talk in the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041BE)
If a time paradox occurs, the world might take irreparable damage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041CE)
150... 149... 148...

#WRITE(PTR, $000041DE)
Damage the likes of me can't even begin to compensate for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043CC)
The discharge phenomenon occurs inside the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043DC)
All is well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043EC)
Now I just need to press the send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043FC)
136... 135... 134...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000440C)
Can't stop now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441C)
Because I'm looking ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442C)
Curiosity pushes me from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443C)
There's no way this will destroy the world.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000444C)
That's what I tell myself.
