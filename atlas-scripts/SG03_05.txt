Operation Urd?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
【倫太郎】
That reminds me, yesterday, because of a certain assistant, I was unable to announce the operation name, wasn't I? The serial D-mail experiments we performed from last night to today. Operation Urd consists of those──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001678)
【紅莉栖】
The experiments had results
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001688)
Assistant interrupts my words again.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001698)
【紅莉栖】
At the very least, we know we can do something with D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
Placing the empty noodle cup on the table, Kurisu pulls the whiteboard out of the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
Then she writes some sort of list.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
The three of us watch Kurisu silently write on the whiteboard while we eat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
【紅莉栖】
And, well, it's like this. Any suggestions or objections?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BE)
Nothing especially. She's summarized the vital parts. Nobody raises their hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CE)
Mayuri's staring blankly with her mouth half open. Looks like she doesn't understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DE)
【倫太郎】
The upper limit of what can be sent in a D-mail is 36 letters in English, or 18 characters in Japanese, which is inconvenient. It's something I'd like to improve.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EE)
The dozens of experimental mails we sent were received in three parts of 6 full width/12 half width letters each. And any text after the 18th-- for half width, the 36th-- would disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【至】
But isn't it great we discovered we can control when it goes to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
Though we can only set it in one hour increments, we can control how far back D-mails go using the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
【紅莉栖】
There's no point to settle for just discovery. We need to find out the principle. What I've written here is nothing but verified phenomena.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
【倫太郎】
Investigating the principle, huh. Certainly, unless we figure that out, we can't make a true time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
【倫太郎】
We can only send 12x3 letters. What's the cause?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001910)
Daru and Kurisu are remain silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193A)
Suddenly, Mayuri, who had until now been staring at the ceiling in confusion, started raising her hand for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
【まゆり】
You know, karaage and bananas become 'gelage' and 'gelbanas', but salt doesn't turn into 'gelsalt', did it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001964)
【至】
Like I said, don't shorten it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001974)
According to what Mayuri had confirmed, the karaage that returned to the freezer had indeed become gelatinous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
【まゆり】
And so, for D-mails, you can send 36 letters, but everything past that disappears, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A8)
【まゆり】
So, I think maybe you can't send big things, or a lot of things-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C2)
【まゆり】
Ah, maybe, maybe the Curb black hole──

Uhh, it's Kerr black hole.

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F6)

【紅莉栖】
Like I said, Kerr black hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2A)
【まゆり】
...the black hole's hole is too tight-

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)

Mayu-shi... say that one more time. Starting from 'hole'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5E)
【まゆり】
Hole is too tight-

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A78)
【至】
This is outrageous!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A92)
【倫太郎】
Don't make her say that, Retardaru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA2)
Damn sexual harasser.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB2)
Since Mayuri has a field of flowers for a brain, she doesn't even realize she's being sexually harassed, leaving a horrible end result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD8)
【紅莉栖】
The hole is tight... huh. That might not be entirely wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【紅莉栖】
Perhaps it has the same problem as SERN's time machine. Since they can't fully control the lifter, they can't make the singular points perfectly naked, therefore limiting the sending capacity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
【至】
Setting aside Karaage and Bananas, 6 full width or 12 full width characters' worth of data is 12 bytes, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
Thinking about data unit conversion is a really Daru thing to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
【紅莉栖】
Bytes? Not kilobytes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B46)

Ohhhh? So Makise-shi's the weak-at-mechanics type?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B56)
【倫太郎】
Pff, is that so, Assistant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
【紅莉栖】
Sh-shut up. Lately, you don't see things measured in bytes, so I was just making sure....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
By the way, 1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes. 1 byte is 8 bits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9A)
【至】
Well, e-mail isn't just comprised of text, though. There's more to it, like the sender's and the receiver's mail addresses, the header, and various othe rthings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAA)
【至】
As an estimate, we can send three batches of 12 bytes of data, then? Ah, by the way, I don't know if using a subject or not changes anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBA)
【倫太郎】
But I'm pretty certain that converting karaage or bananas into data doesn't come out to a 12 byte size.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCA)
There's still the question of whether you can even do that in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDA)
【倫太郎】
Since each grain of salt is tiny, it's possible they could be converted to less than 12 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF4)
【紅莉栖】
So does that mean a large mass would get crushed by super gravity?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C04)
【倫太郎】
It might not be mass. Data doesn't have mass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1E)
【紅莉栖】
In any case, since the singular points aren't made naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2E)
【紅莉栖】
Inside that event horizon, space and time switch places, causing the subject who arrived at the ring singularity to reach ultra high speed...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3E)
【紅莉栖】
The data crushed and destroyed by super gravity is shot out of the black hole....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)
【倫太郎】
As a jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C68)
【紅莉栖】
But I don't think having small mass would allow an object to go through. Both have to get out of super gravity, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【倫太郎】
If the hole is too tight, then just increase electron injection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C92)
【紅莉栖】
I don't think it's that simple. I mean, SERN should've tested that method. Yet it's been 9 years since they started experiments and they haven't gotten any results.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA2)
【紅莉栖】
It's not something as simple as increasing the amount of electrons.

I-I see....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCC)
【紅莉栖】
In the first place, SERN does have a Lifter, but we don't know what substitutes that Lifter in the Microwave Ophone. Then there's the problem of adjustment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDC)
Certainly....
<END>

【倫太郎】
We don't know what replaces the Lifter, but──

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CFC)

At least we know for certain that by its effect, we've created a path to send up to 36 bytes + α data through the ring singularity.

For on this day today, our Future Gadget Laboratory, has developed──

The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!

But it's not the first you know? SERN beat us.

And you can't even say developed. You just coincidentally made it.

Hmph, looks like Assistant doesn't know the meaning of the word 'serendipity', huh. <DICT>Penicillin</DICT>, <DICT>X-rays</DICT>, and <DICT>dynamite</DICT>, among many others, are inventions born from coincidence!

But-, Chris-chan said before that time machines don't exist, right-? She just admit it now, didn't she-♪

...It's just that I have to admit it at present. If we investigate the principle, it might turn out to be something that only seems like a time machine.

If I claim the development of the first-- no, maybe second, whatever-- time machine in human history all for myself, don't complain to me afterwards!

Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn't know. And it's even the 66th.

Or so I say, but I'm so excited we could use D-mail better than expected, so maybe I can't fall asleep.

Curiosity grows inside my heart.

Though, I still have anxiety in my heart that we've stepped into the world's unthinkable darkness──

Sending mail into the past

#WRITE(PTR, $00002698)
We've obtained that dream-like power.

Now, when I start thinking of how to use it, my imagination spreads out infinitely, driving away all anxiety.
