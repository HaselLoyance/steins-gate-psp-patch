【倫太郎】
...And without further ado, let us commence the final phase of Operation 'Norn of the Present'"Verthandi".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029C)
Mayuri and Daru look at me and nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AC)
Today's the last day of ComiMa, which Daru was originally looking forward to attending, but he prioritized this once I begged him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BC)
I take a look around the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CC)
Before I noticed, our lab mem count had returned to three.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DC)
In these past 20 days of turmoil, that number had at one point increased to eight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002EC)
All the memories of those days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FC)
All the people we met those days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000030C)
I, for the sake of saving Mayuri, will make them never happen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000031C)
It is kind of lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032C)
I do feel a little guilty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033C)
I will engrave everything deep within my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034C)
I will never forget. I must not forget. About these long yet short summer days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000035C)
Even still, I chose to return things to the start by erasing these memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000036C)
It has nothing to do with the future Suzuha told us about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000037C)
As long as Mayuri will live, it's fine by me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038C)
【倫太郎】
Daru, please start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039C)
【至】
...this is okay, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AC)
【倫太郎】
...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C6)
【至】
Okey-dokey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E2)
Daru begins tapping on the IBN 5100's keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F2)
This retromachine we had finally gotten back was already connected to Daru's favorite cutting-edge PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000402)
If we use this, we can access SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000412)
We will trespass upon the database at the heart of SERN only accessible with an IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000422)
Then we will locate the data of the First D-mail I sent to Daru on 728, and erase it from Echelon's accumulated log.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000432)
With this, I can access the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000442)
There lies the world where Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000452)
Spying on Mayuri's condition, I see her sitting down on the couch tightly straightening her spine, with her grandma's memento pocketwatch, "Pocketty~" to her ear. She's staying quiet with her eyes closed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000462)
Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she always listens to the sound of that pocketwatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000472)
I told Mayuri everything beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000482)
I told Mayuri everything beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000492)
It seems like she's prepared herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004A2)
I've been leaving the cracking to Daru, so there's no problem there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000542)
I walk into the development room, having a little left to attend to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000552)
The Time Leap Machine is placed in the center of the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000562)
Squatting down, I gently brush the face of the microwave with my fingertip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000572)
Cool to the touch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000582)
Ever since I had this, I've met irreplaceable partners, and I've hurt irreplaceable partners.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000592)
But I don't want to blame the tool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A2)
Because everthing depends on how you use the tool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B2)
It's also true that I've been saved by this thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C2)
But still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D2)
...When everything's over, I'm going to destroy the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E2)
【至】
So that I never make the same mistakes again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B6)
【倫太郎】
Okarin, I found it! It's seriously in there!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D0)
【至】
It's in there? The D-mail I sent!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E0)
It's in there good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F0)
Daru points at a string of characters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000700)
There I could clearly see my name and the text I wrote about Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000710)
Three lines total.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000720)
Each only six characters of Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000730)
SERN found out about us because this data was there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000740)
At FB's instruction, the Rounders, including Moeka, attacked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000750)
If what Suzuha said was true, then if we erased this data, we can escape from the α World Line where SERN dominates the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000760)
Attractor Field β.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000770)
The β World Line that converges to that range.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B8)
There, the future where Mayuri dies in August 2010 doesn't come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C8)
Before I noticed, Mayuri was also standing next to me, gazing at the monitor with great interest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E2)
【まゆり】
Her hand firmly grasps mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F2)
【倫太郎】
Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000802)
It's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000081C)
【至】
Since she was making an anxious face, I pat her head with a pomf to calm her down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082C)
I set it up so that pressing the enter key will erase the data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083C)
【至】
Daru stand up, opening the seat up for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084C)
I leave that ceremonial act to Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085C)
I sit in the seat when he tells me that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BE)
I gulp down my breath in front of the keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CE)
This time for sure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AE)
This time for sure will bring an end to everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BE)
Kurisu's face floats through my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
I close my eyes and take a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
...goodbye, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
I slowly raise my right hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1A)
【倫太郎】
I tightly extend my index finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B34)
The time of triumph has come!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B44)
【倫太郎】
Upon my cry, Daru, standing next to me, is taken by surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B54)
【倫太郎】
I myself, without giving in to any conspiracy, have adhered to my own belief, fighting the Final Crusade"Ragnarok" to the bitter end!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6E)
I give gratitude to my comrades, who fought alongside me, as my hands and feet for the sake this triumph!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7E)
If I press this key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8E)
Kurisu will die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9E)
I firmly grasp at the shoulder of my coat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAE)
【倫太郎】
It's mended with a pink thread, with bumpy stitches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBE)
The world we arive at- is the world I wished for!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCE)
Mayuri's life. And also, Kurisu's death. That is what I wished for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDE)
I will never forget this truth. I must never forget.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEE)
【倫太郎】
This is──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFE)
Everything is Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0E)
【倫太郎】
This is my choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C76)
The world... shall be remade──！
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D38)
I vigorously swing down my extended finger,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
And at the same time, hear the sound of the lab door opening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA8)
【紅莉栖】
I cast but a fleeting glance in that direction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC8)
Right there... was Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD8)
Her face is flushed; was she running?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE8)
Why could she be here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF8)
She should've gone to Narita.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E08)
She even said she was going back to America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E18)
Kurisu was looking at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
With a face about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
With a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
Did she come back for me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
──Since we didn't say goodbye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
If felt like Kurisu whispered something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB0)
Immediately afterward, the finger I swung down struck the enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC0)
The world started to bend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD0)
The world was being reconfigured.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE0)
My consciousness was slowly being compressed into the time warp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF0)
Reading Steiner activated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101A)
The Divergence was changing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
Kurisu's tearful face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
And Daru and Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BA)
And the insides of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CA)
The distortion of everything sped up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DA)
The color of everything faded away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EA)
My consciousness separated from this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FA)
At least, at the very end, I will burn into these eyes the image of Kurisu's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001168)
【紅莉栖】
Waving my hand a little, I turn towards her──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001178)
【紅莉栖】
Goodbye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
Okabe, I also──
<FILEENDA2>
