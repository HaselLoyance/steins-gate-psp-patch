Okarin-? Ah, there he is-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C94)
Mayuri enters the door with a sour look on her lips.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA4)
She didn't say her tutturu- catchprhase today. She looks unusually pouty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7A)
【倫太郎】
You're early. It's still 8. Something going on today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8A)
【まゆり】
I came to scold you, Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9A)
She says so, but there's no real strength to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAA)
She's been bad at getting angry since the old days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBA)
【まゆり】
You know, Mayushii's disappointed in you, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCA)
Mayuri points at me with puffed cheeks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDA)
【倫太郎】
Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF4)
【まゆり】
Don't play dumb. Okarin, you made Luka-chan cry, didn't you-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
【倫太郎】
H-how did you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E14)
【まゆり】
Luka-chan consulted me. She said you said she was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E24)
【倫太郎】
Mmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E34)
I see. Luka and Mayuri are good friends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E44)
If Lukako cries, then there's nowhere she can go except to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E54)
I should've thought about that...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E64)
【まゆり】
Okarin, why did you say such a mean thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E74)
【倫太郎】
M-Mayuri, it doesn't involve you. It's a serious, confidential matter involving the 'Organization'──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8E)
【まゆり】
It does so involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii's friend, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
【まゆり】
If you won't talk, then Mayushii and Okarin are breaking off, okay? 'Cause I'll quit being a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
This is the first time Mayuri's been so angry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
To be honest, I was bewildered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECE)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey, why did you say such a mean thing-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDE)
It was necessary to save you──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEE)
I didn't say it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFE)
I don't want Mayuri to know my motives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0E)
I don't want to give this optimistic girl the verdict You will die in a few days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1E)
So, did I fail yesterday when I told Lukako that Mayuri would get killed...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2E)
I was temporarily lost for words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
【まゆり】
...you're worried about something, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F58)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
Even though she doesn't seem to be thinking anything, she's still sharp....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
【まゆり】
I can tell-. I mean, Mayushii sees Okarin every day, after all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F92)
【まゆり】
And yesterday, you were talking with Chris-chan for a loong time, weren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA2)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)

If you're worried about something, you can ask Mayushii too, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)

I want you to talk to Mayushii too.... Okay? So, will you go apologize to Luka-chan? Will you go make up? Mayushii will come too, if you want...

O-Okarin?

【倫太郎】
Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Go away and boil your head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001026)
【倫太郎】
I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, you know? I have nothing to worry about!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001036)

All I do have... is the craving, the ambition for chaos! Fuhahahaha!

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
【まゆり】
Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
It's not something Mayuri should know, by any means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
Even if Mayuri hates me for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001110)
Something important? What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001120)
I told her everything yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001130)
Including Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001140)
Maybe she calmly thought about it all night, and decided to believe in what I had to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
【倫太郎】
Alright...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001166)
I get up from the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001180)
【まゆり】
Where are you going-? Mayushii's not done talking...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001190)
【倫太郎】
I'm going to Lukako's place now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AA)
【まゆり】
Really? You're going to apologize? Then let Mayushii──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
【倫太郎】
No, you'll cause all sorts of problems if you come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CA)
I put my hand on Mayuri's shoulder, warning her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DA)
【倫太郎】
So please, watch over the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F4)
Mayuri looks somehow lonely as she drops her shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001344)
When I run into the shrine grounds, Lukako was standing there alone, not in her usual miko garb, but in plainclothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001354)
She still hasn't noticed me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
Lukako stood still, in the still shrine grounds, the only movement being the silhouettes of the trees swaying in the summer sun. A scene straight from a fairy tale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001374)
I stop and watch in fascination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
And then, Lukako turns around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E8)
Our eyes meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F8)
【倫太郎】
...Mmhmm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001408)
I unnaturally clear my throat and walk towards him-- no, towards her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
Lukako bows her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
【るか】
So you came...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001438)
【るか】
Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
We look at each other in the still grounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
Ah crap. It got awkward somehow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
I can't stand this silence. So I start up the conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001484)
【倫太郎】
What did you talk to Mayuri about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AA)
【るか】
...So-sorry. But I couldn't talk about this to anyone but Mayuri-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014BA)
【倫太郎】
I mean, how much did you tell her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CA)
【るか】
I kept, most of it a secret. Including the stuff about Mayuri-chan's death...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DA)
Hearing that's a relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EA)
【倫太郎】
Do you still think I'm joking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014FA)
Lukako shakes her head side to side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150A)
Meaning, she believes me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
【倫太郎】
Umm, what could you mean by something impurrtant to talk about, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152A)
I tried to use a gentle tone of voice, but ended up talking like Faris instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153A)
I really can't deal with Lukako now that she's a girl after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001560)
【るか】
...Um
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001570)
Lukako takes a deep breath as if to prepare herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001580)
Her face is randomly turning red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001590)
She opens her mouth to speak, but stops. Over and over again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A0)
Lukako's abnormally tense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B0)
That tension infects me, and my heart starts pounding like an alarm bell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C0)
【るか】
I, I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D0)
【倫太郎】
Y-yes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E0)
【るか】
...want to ask...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F0)
【倫太郎】
Mmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001600)
【るか】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001610)
【るか】
Okabe-san... what you said yesterday...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
【倫太郎】
Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
【るか】
I... believe it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【倫太郎】
I, I see!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
So basically, that means she'll go back to being a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
Even though I had hurt her feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
For her to believe me in spite of that, makes me honestly happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001696)
But something's strange about Lukako. Her tension shows no sign of loosing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A6)
Rather, it's leveled up to a half-crying state.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
【るか】
...so, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C6)
【るか】
In exchange... for becoming a guy again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D6)
Exchange? She wants something in return?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E6)
I never expected Lukako to make such a proposal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F6)
【るか】
Today... and tomorrow...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001706)
【るか】
It's okay... if it's only for before Mayuri-chan gets in danger, so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001716)
What? What's she talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001726)
My throat goes dry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001736)
I'm so tense I don't understand why.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
【るか】
...so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
【るか】
...Please be my...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
【倫太郎】
...Hm? I couldn't quite hear you. One more time please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
Lukako's voice was more delicate than ever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
So much that I couldn't hear it from here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001796)
【るか】
...Please be my l...er
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A6)
No good, I still can't hear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B6)
【倫太郎】
Please say it clearly. 'Cause I'll do anything I can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C6)
【るか】
Lo...er...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D6)
【倫太郎】
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001802)
【るか】
P-please be my l-lover...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001812)
... ... ....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001822)
What, was that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001832)
L o v e r.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001842)
The word takes severe detours through my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
It doesn't register immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001862)
Or rather, my brain isn't working.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001872)
Lukako melted it completely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001882)
She's fidgeting, hanging her head as if she couldn't lift it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001892)
Waves form in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A2)
The ripples won't settle easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B2)
Just now-- what did Lukako say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C2)
What did she say to me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D2)
L o v e r.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Lo ver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
Lover.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
Lovers, for just today and tomorrow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
Wha-wha-wha-what--!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192E)
【倫太郎】
Wh, why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193E)
Without thinking, I asked the worst question possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001964)
Lukako shrinks more and more──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001974)
【るか】
cause...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001984)
【るか】
Because... I love you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001994)
...Those words were as small as the buzzing of a mosquito, but had all the courage she could muster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A4)
Unconsciously, my chest felt like it tightened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B4)

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C4)

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F4)
【倫太郎】

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A04)
More silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A14)
W-wait just a second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
If you say this so suddenly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
No, it wasn't sudden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
At the very least, I noticed Lukako's feelings when Kurisu told me about that flag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A54)
Even so, I didn't think it would come to this....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A64)
My mind goes blank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A74)
I can't think straight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A84)
【るか】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A94)
Lukako hangs her head, waiting for my answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA4)
Seeing her brave, innocent figure, I feel Lukako's loveliness──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
Nonono!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
Bad!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
It's Bad!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B30)
Feeling her loveliness is NO GOOD!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
【倫太郎】
L-let me think about it! Give me two, no, five minutes!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
I turn around as I scream that and break off at full speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBE)
I'm so ashamed, I can't look back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D22)
After more than five minutes, almost ten, I get back to the lab. Mayuri's eating anman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
【まゆり】
Ah, Okarin. How'd it go-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4C)
【まゆり】
Did you make sure to apologize to Luka-chan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)

Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Karaage Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-mail's basically ABC and...

The microwave oven works as the "knights" who inherited the ideals of the <DICT>Rosicruician Order</DICT> by producing <DICT>alchemy</DICT>. The sound of the chime is the brainwashing device but the chime itself actually doesn't have any meaning at all...

What are you doing-?

#WRITE(PTR, $00002824)
She says so without looking at me.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002834)
I see, she's still working on the Time Leap Machine improvements.

So, basically, tell me the differences between the male brain and the female brain.

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F8)
【紅莉栖】
I don't get you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002908)
I briefly explain what happened with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002918)
And the current situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002928)
How many times have I explained this to Kurisu now....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC0)
【るか】
Ah, Okabe-san... and, Makise-san. Did you come to worship today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD0)
Lukako, seeing me and Kurisu, loses her focus as she says so.

これが俺が考えた作戦、その名も“オペレーション・クリスティーナ”である。

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B22)
ルカ子の俺という人間を見る目には、バイアスがかかっている。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B32)
俺から“お前は男だ”と告げると、感情的な反応をされるのはすでに経験済みだ。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B42)
よって、ルカ子とはそれほど繋がりがなく、なおかつ同性同士で話しやすいだろうという理由から、紅莉栖に真相を告げる役を押しつけ├┤じゃなくて買って出てもらったのだ。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B52)
というわけで俺は紅莉栖の背後に控え、黙って様子を見ていた。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6C)
【るか】
What could it be?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7C)
Lukako is shy. He was distant with me too back when we first met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8C)
I can see she's made a small wall between Kurisu and herself now too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9C)
On the other hand, Kurisu's very calm. She truly is reliable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAC)
Kurisu puts on a gentle smile and begins explaining to Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
【紅莉栖】
Male and female brains work completely differently. Did you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE0)
【るか】
What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BF0)
Hey, hey....

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C00)
【紅莉栖】
Males use their right brains more. Females use their left brains more.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C10)
【るか】
Eh, eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C2A)
【紅莉栖】
By the way, the right brain handles image processing, spacial processing, and comprehensive judgment. The left brain handles language and calculation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C3A)
【紅莉栖】
The right and left brains are connected by the corpus callosum, but it's more developed in females.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C54)
【紅莉栖】
Lots of people say it, don't they? That females can do more than two things at once. That can be explained by the development of the corpus callosum.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C64)
【るか】
uh... what...?

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C74)
Just what is she talking about....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8E)
【紅莉栖】
Well, which one's which is almost like scientific myth, though. Its credibility really isn't that high.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9E)
【紅莉栖】
But how about we try it out just a little?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB8)
【るか】
Try, what out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD2)
【紅莉栖】
I want to try mapping out your brain patterns to see if they match a female's or a male's patterns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE2)
【るか】
What is mapping...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF2)
Lukako is clearly frightened.

N-no thanks...

It'll be okay, I promise. I guarantee it, so come on, come on...

What kind of perverted old man are you!?

【紅莉栖】
Fwahn! ...Wh, what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EFE)

Don't you what me! What did we come here for!? What are you going to do if you scare Lukako!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F18)
【紅莉栖】
I'm just treating her like a valuable test sub──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F28)
【倫太郎】
Go home, you experiment-loving-girl!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F38)
【紅莉栖】
Yeah, okay. So that's the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you. I'll just go home like you said. You're on your own now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F54)
While mumbling complaints, Kurisu leaves the shrine with squared shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6E)
【るか】
Okabe-san, um, what was Makise-san talking about...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7E)
【倫太郎】
Well, basically, uhh...

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8E)
D-do I have to explain everything again in the end...?

You, you're actually a guy.

The result was the same, without even having to think about it.

I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000321C)
It's morning now.

It's nice that it's cool early in the morning, even though it's the middle of summer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000323C)
Though the crickets are already chirping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324C)
The sunlight isn't too strong yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000325C)
This morning sky, and this changing of the calendar. I've already seen them before....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000326C)
At least, my mental state is exactly the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327C)
Outside the door, the sound of someone vigorously ascending the stairs resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000328C)
I thought it was Moeka and got up in a hurry, but then I suddenly realized.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000329C)
The one who appears so hurriedly in this situation isn't Moeka──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000346C)
【まゆり】
Okarin-? Ah, there he is-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003488)
Mayuri enters with a sour look on her lips.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003498)
By all rights, Mayuri should have stayed in the lab today, but last night she got a call from someone and left in a hurry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A8)
...She probably went to go meet Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357E)
【まゆり】
You know, Mayushii's disappointed in you, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000358E)
Mayuri points at me with puffed cheeks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000359E)
So that was it after all... I sigh in frustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035AE)
Before I time leaped, I heard Mayuri say these words on the 14th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035BE)
Today is the 12th. In any case, since I explained the situation to Lukako yesterday, it looks like Mayuri's protest came early too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035D8)
【まゆり】
Okarin, you made Luka-chan cry, didn't you-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035E8)
【まゆり】
Luka-chan consulted me. She said you said she was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035F8)
【まゆり】
Okarin, why did you say such a mean thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003608)
【倫太郎】
...I'm going to meet her now, so don't worry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003622)
【まゆり】
Eh? Really-? Thank goodness. If Okarin said he wasn't going to apologize, the Mayushii was going to break her relationship with Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003632)
The mail should come soon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
It did come after all....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
If I go to Yanabayashi Shrine now, what's waiting for me there is that confession scene.

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B6)
【るか】
P-please be my l-lover...!

When I start yelling at the development room in a loud voice, I start to hear the sounds of someone moving inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D0)
【まゆり】
Chris-chan's sleeping, you know-? She worked all night, so you shouldn't wake her-

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E0)
I know, but I have to do this.

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F0)

Christina! Please wake up!

#WRITE(PTR, $00003900)
【紅莉栖】
...Oh, shut up.

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A4A)
Kurisu comes out of the development room with sleepy eyes.

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A5A)
【まゆり】
Chris-chan, tutturu-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A6A)
【紅莉栖】
......

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A7A)
Last night, she fell asleep at the desk after working so long, so the sleeves of her clothes left a mark on her cheek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8A)
Her hair is frayed and her eyes are red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9A)
She rubs her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAA)
【紅莉栖】
What is it?

I'm gonna go to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me.

Until... the 15th...

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CB4)
It's the same after all, huh....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CD0)
And since it's until the 15th, that means it's now 4 days including today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CE0)
Before I time leaped, she said for just today and tomorrow, but now the time's doubled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF0)
She came out with something delicate and bold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D00)
But that's that. Better safe than sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D10)
Now's the time to set "Operation Christina II" into motion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D20)
Things got complicated when I had that experiment-loving-girl add to the conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D30)
I forcibly persuaded Kurisu to help against her will, but this time I had her watch things from up above on the highway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D40)
【倫太郎】
S-sorry. P-please wait a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E96)
I turn my back to Lukako and call Kurisu.

Sup, %CFF008normalfag&c40;?

【倫太郎】
You don't understand people's feelings either. Who's a normalfag?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1A)
【倫太郎】
Did you listen to what Lukako said just now?

You didn't listen!?

【紅莉栖】
There's no way I can hear from this far away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F92)
【倫太郎】
Confession. Until the 15th. Then turn back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FAE)
【紅莉栖】
I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FBE)
【紅莉栖】
Hmm, so, why did you consult me for every little thing? You should just grant Urushibara-san's wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FDA)
【倫太郎】
Bu-but it's Lukako!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FF6)

What's wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004012)

But he's a──

#WRITE(PTR, $0000402E)
【紅莉栖】
Her originally being a guy might just be your deluision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000403E)
【紅莉栖】
The way I see it, she's always been a 'she'.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000405A)
【倫太郎】
Guh...

#WRITE(PTR, $00004076)

Just give up. Bye.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004092)
【倫太郎】
Ah, wai──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C2)
She hung up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D2)
【倫太郎】
Mm, mmmm... why did I even bring her along...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E2)
Such a useless assistant!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F8)
I stuff my phone into my pocket and head towards Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000414C)
【るか】
Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000415C)

Hm? Ah, yeah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000416C)
【るか】
Is that so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004186)
【るか】
Okabe-san, it kinda seemed... like it was a really fun conversation, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004196)
【倫太郎】
H-how...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041A6)
Is this pressure? Is she applying psychological pressure!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041C0)
【るか】
So, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041D0)
Lukako fidgets restlessly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041E0)
【るか】
Your... answer...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F2)
Please be my lover
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004302)
A limited time trial relationship of only four days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004312)
Will those four days feel long, or short?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004368)
Lukako certainly does have cute facial features.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004378)
She has the image of very slender hands and a slender waist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004388)
Her skin is transparent white like alabaster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004398)
Honestly speaking, I've been fascinated several times by Lukako's demeanor even back when he was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043A8)
The current Lukako is biologically a girl, so even if we go out and do this and that, there really shouldn't be a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043B8)
But──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000440E)
At the same time, I'm on a mission to change Lukako back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441E)
If I don't, I can't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442E)
Basically, if I go out with the girl Lukako, and fall in love with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443E)
In the end, will I be able to see the guy Lukako as a guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000444E)
If I can't and then lose self control, what waits for me is──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000446C)
Uho!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000447C)
There's no problem going out with the current Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000448C)
Of course, my heart's not sorted out, but cute is justice, so who really cares?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000449C)
The source of my hesitation is thinking what comes after that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044AC)
The problem isn't Lukako, but my own heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044BC)
And what I should be doing now isn't romance, but saving Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004512)
But Lukako's cooperation is essential to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004522)
If I refuse here and make Lukako cry, nothing will change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004532)
I need to ignore the problems in my heart for the sake of my goal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004542)
Let's accept.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004552)
Let's accept Lukako's deal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004562)
But before that, there's one thing I need to convince myself deep down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000457E)
...I must not fall in love with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000458E)
Even if my way of thinking tramples over her feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000459E)
I must still not fall in love.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045AE)
If I fall in love, I might end up walking down forbidden roads.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045BE)
Lukako is a guy. A guy. A guy a guy a guy.

#WRITE(PTR, $000045CE)
GuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuy....

#WRITE(PTR, $000045DE)
And don't you forget it.

As long as you never forget──

I'll go out with you. But just until the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046D4)
【るか】
Ah...

#WRITE(PTR, $000046EE)
Soon, tears start spilling out of Lukako's eyes.

#WRITE(PTR, $000046FE)
【倫太郎】
Wh, why are you crying!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000470E)
【るか】
Ugh... sniff... I'm, h-happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000471E)

I was sure, that you'd say no...

Her face flushes red, wet with tears, yet she's really happy. Though she's a bit shy and embarrassed, seeing Lukako's bravery makes me──

Crap...! I hnnged again...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000477A)
I mustn't fall in love, but I'm about to!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000478A)
Why does every single one of her actions tickle my male instincts!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000479A)
She must be doing it on purpose! There's no mistaking it! There's just no other way!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047AA)
Lukako's cuteness is a terror of the universe.

...Um, Okabe-san

#WRITE(PTR, $000047D4)

Wh-what!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047E4)
Lukako timidly mutters while wiping her tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047FE)
【るか】
Well... tomorrow... a da...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000480E)
Da?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000481E)
What does she mean by da?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000482E)
【るか】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000483E)
【るか】
Please... take me... on a date.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000484E)
【倫太郎】
What...did you say...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000485E)
A date...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000486E)
Certainly, when two lovers go out somewhere together, that's called a date.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000487E)
It would really be a dick move if I refused to go on a date right after we started going out, wouldn't it....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000488E)
【倫太郎】
I don't mind going, but where?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048A8)
【るか】
Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048B8)
Doesn't look like she's decided.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048D2)
【るか】
I want to go where you want to go, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048E2)
【るか】
Umm, basically, I want to know the places you like, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048F2)
So basically, she wants me to decide for her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004902)
It's really unfair to have such a cute face that people will forgive anything you say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004912)
I scratch my head in thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004922)
【倫太郎】
...then, I'll think of some plans until tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004932)
Anyway, I want to get away from this irritatingly sentimental alone time with her, so that's what I answered.
