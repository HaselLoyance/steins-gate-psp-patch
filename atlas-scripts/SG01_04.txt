An unidentified large object has crashed into a building in front of the Akihabara station.
<END>

Currently the area is restricted by the police and it's forbidden to go in front of the building but if you look at the object from a distance it resembles a space satellite!

I throw a glance down from the overpass which connects UPX and Daibiru and it looks like there are more people than usual today.

There are also some weird-looking teenagers among them and they definitely don't seem like people who would normally visit Akiba.

They all seem to be going towards the Central Street which is still off limits.

Daru won't you go to the Radio Center for some sightseeing?

Even if I go there I won't be able to see it. And anyway I'm constantly monitoring the net for any news about it. The number of threads on @chan has already exceeded 100 and that's awesome!

Ahhh... it's so cool. I'm coming back to life. abababababa...

There's air conditioning in Daibiru so this is like an oasis for us poor university students.

We might acquire some answers to the problems concerning the Microwave Ophone (Temp).

It's annoying so can you stop using the '(Temp)' already?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001302)
That will not shake my resolution. Even if no other lab members say it I will keep using it until I decide on a better name.

Right now that doesn't matter.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
【至】
So did you come up with some ridiculous theory again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
【倫太郎】
What are you mean ridiculous? I have already transcended all the things in this world's nature and am constantly thinking about the limitless possibilities... Don't you dare call that ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135E)

By 'transcended all the things in nature' you mean that you're talking about whatever you want huh? I wouldn't even call that theorizing.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136E)

Daru I believe that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) might be the key that will open the Steins;Gate. What do you make of that?

That Stein-whatever doesn't even have a proper meaning.

Kyah--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001654)
I bump into a person.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001664)
I quickly grab the person's shoulder to support her.

Excuse me.

This woman's face.

Ah... ah...!

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
I enter a state of shock.

Chills run down my spine.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
I can't even move my fingers.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175A)
My gaze is fixed on the face of the person in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
Her innocence makes her seem like a girl rather than a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
I already looked at this graceful face about 3 hours ago.

Uhm... is there a problem?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
Kurisu makes a puzzled face and tries to get away from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
However I don't let go of her shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
Instead I put more strength to my grip.

And...

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Her clothes are the same she wore that time and they're completely clean.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
No matter how much I stare at them it doesn't look like she's injured anywhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
With that amount of bleeding she must've had a heavy wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
【倫太郎】
Unharmed...!

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)

W- it hurts...! Let go...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C84)
Kurisu pushes me away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C94)
Then she glares at me with a vigilant look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA4)
She doesn't seem like an injured person at all.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB4)
【紅莉栖】
... What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)

You're alright? Your wounds are fine? No that's impossible! Makise Kurisu was stabbed and lying in a pool of blood she--

That story again?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1C)
The one who cut me off was Daru.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2C)
And he just said something weird.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
【倫太郎】
What do you mean by that?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4C)

You sent me a mail like that a week ago.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
【倫太郎】
A mail? Me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D6C)
【倫太郎】
Don't be absurd! I saw that Makise Kurisu was killed just about 3 hours ago!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【紅莉栖】
Hey. Please don't just kill me off okay? I'm perfectly alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA0)
【至】
Speaking of which that mail was very weird. The date said that it was sent 'after' 1 week. Which implies that it came from the future...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF0)
【紅莉栖】
Came from the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E00)

Did you check out some weird website Daru? It's unusual for you to spout ridiculous theories.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F04)
なぜこんな短い文面を３通に分けて送ったんだ、俺は？
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F14)
それに３通目は、途中で途切れてしまったかのようにも見える。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F24)
こんな短文メールを送った記憶はない。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F34)
だが文面には見覚えがあった。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F84)
【倫太郎】
This is... The mail I sent 3 hours ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
However I sent a single mail not 3. And I entered more words than this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA4)
Did Daru actually receive this 1 week ago? On the 21st?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC4)
【紅莉栖】
Very interesting...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD4)
Wait when did she get here? Kurisu is glaring at the screen of the cellphone with a serious look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002098)
Oh right! The mail doesn't matter! Well maybe it does but not now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A8)
Currently the more important question is 'why is she perfectly fine!?'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B8)
Is this an illusion!? No a ghost!? Have I been cursed or something!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C8)
As a mad scientist I refuse to believe such unscientific things!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
I timidly extend my hand towards Kurisu's face...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F6)
... and touch her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002306)
I can actually feel the cuticles her silk-like hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002316)
【倫太郎】
Sh-she's here and I can touch her... To think that I just thought that she's a ghost... How silly of me.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234C)

O-Okarin... Ain't that a bit dangerous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EE)
I keep poking Kurisu's cheek with my finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FE)
Such wonderful softness and skin tension. It's completely different from a dead bod- wait I never actually touched one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002418)
【紅莉栖】
... Hey
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002428)
Anyway I already touched her shoulder when we bumped into each other and when she pushed me away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
My assumption that she has no body is nothing but proof that I'm in a state of confusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
Then what was that gruesome scene I saw in the Radio Center? What exactly was that man's scream I heard?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002458)
Was that series of events an illusion just like the mass disappearance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002468)
That's right wounds! If that was real then the Makise Kurisu right here must have injuries!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002478)
I must investigate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000251A)
I grab the edge of her clothes and slowly try to to move them aside--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
【紅莉栖】
Do you want cops coming after you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D6)
【倫太郎】
... I just want to find out the truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E6)
While Makise Kurisu is shaking with anger I return her a direct gaze and move her jacket aside--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002600)
【紅莉栖】
What's that all about you PERVERT!? Are you stupid!? Do you want to die!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C8)
She pushes my hand aside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【至】
That's <DICT>Louise-chan</DICT>'s famous line!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F2)
I ignore Daru's screaming and continue talking without flinching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
【倫太郎】
I'm perfectly sure that I saw it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271C)
【紅莉栖】
Wait! Did you just saw my underw...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272C)
Kurisu's face reddens as she quickly tries to cover herself up.

You imbecile! That's not it!

#WRITE(PTR, $00002756)
【紅莉栖】

#WRITE(PTR, $000027D6)
Noon today after the ending of Doctor Nakabachi's presentation Makise Kurisu was killed by someone and lied in a pool of blood--

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E6)
I give her a thorough explanation of that.

Eh? Doctor... Nakabachi...?

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B4)

What are you talking about Okarin? Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled.

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C4)
【倫太郎】
... Cancelled?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D4)
【至】
Yep. Because of the satellite crashing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E4)
Once again the things I've seen and what others tell me are completely different...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F4)
It's the same as the conversation I had with Mayuri after the mass disappearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002904)
I'm feeling uneasy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002914)
Did I get myself involved in something outrageous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002924)
Is this another conspiracy of the Organization?

【紅莉栖】
Hououin-san would you kindly tell me about what you just said in more detail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002988)
Looks like she now understands that I'm not lying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002998)
Even so I don't know why what I know and what others know doesn't match so I doubt that I can give her a good explanation--

Daru goes to the same place where Kurisu just went.
