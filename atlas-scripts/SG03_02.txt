About how we might be attacked by black suits for knowing this outrageous confidential information.

I even told you that bad things aren't good.

Hmph, bad you say? We are? How absurd.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181A)
【倫太郎】
If you must say that, then SERN is even worse. Those guys have lost interest in controlling just the world, and now plan to even get their hands on time-space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182A)
【紅莉栖】
I agree.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183A)
For some reason, Kurisu backs me up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184A)
【紅莉栖】
What SERN is doing is unforgivable to society, unforgivable to humanity, and unforgivable as researchers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185A)
【まゆり】
That's true, but-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186A)
Unsatisfied, Mayuri keeps eating her okaka onigiri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187A)
I didn't want to involve Mayuri, but she's surprisingly perceptive. She'd find out even if we kept it a secret. So it's better to just tell her at the start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A4)
【倫太郎】
Anyway, with this, our lab can no longer escape the Final Crusade"Ragnarok" with SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B4)
I say that halfway as a bluff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C4)
In any case, we can no longer return.

Now that we know, we can no longer erase our memory.

Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN, right!? Did you learn anything new?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001914)
【紅莉栖】
I don't remember being ordered, but whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001924)
【紅莉栖】
SERN faces two problems with time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001934)
【紅莉栖】
First is the adjustment of the Lifter, the electron injection device.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001944)
【紅莉栖】
Unless it functions properly, they can't make the Kerr black hole singularites naked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001954)
【紅莉栖】
If you try to send the test subject through the singularities in this state, they'll be compressed at the micro level via super gravity. Naturally, there's no safety for them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001964)
【紅莉栖】
And the second problem is that they can't designate the destination for time travel. They can't choose where they go after coming out of the singular point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001974)
【紅莉栖】
That's why we should actually consider the 14 found jellymen the lucky ones.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001984)
【紅莉栖】
Over a hundred human experiments were performed starting 2001. Basically, the remaining 80 or so people 'jumped somewhere they can't locate'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A48)
【まゆり】
Why can't they locate them-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A62)

Mayu-shi, did you know this? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kilos, and its orbital speed is 114, 000 kilos──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7C)
Daru's triumphantly explaining to Mayuri, but he's relaying what Kurisu told him last night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8C)
【紅莉栖】
It seems like SERN's looking for solutions to these two problems, but it doesn't seem like it's going well for them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)
So does that mean even SERN is having a hard time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
【倫太郎】
So, Assistant. Did you find anything out about SERN's time machine that could serve as a hint for the Microwave Ophone (Temp)?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
【紅莉栖】
A hint, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
Kurisu looks upwards in thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B30)
【紅莉栖】
To start with, you could call the LHC 'the world's largest microwave oven'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
【倫太郎】
I see! So basically, that means the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is a miniature LHC, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
【紅莉栖】
That might not necessarily be wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B60)
I was sure she'd deny it. In fact, I thought she'd yell at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
But instead, she agreed with me. What an ironic anticlimax.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
【紅莉栖】
However, there are too many things we don't know about the Microwave Ophone. Why do the same phenomena as SERN's time machine occur in that tiny little microwave?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B90)
【紅莉栖】
Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn't made for time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C54)
【まゆり】
It was made to warm Mayushii's karaage, right-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6E)
【紅莉栖】
W-well, yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7E)
【倫太郎】
At the very least, the jellyman phenomenom occurs with the Microwave Ophone (Temp), so we should think that Mayuri's bananas reach the Kerr black hole's ring singularity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【まゆり】
It makes a black hole? Here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB2)
【まゆり】
It won't suck us in, will it-?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC2)
If it sucked us in, we'd become jellymen too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D26)
【紅莉栖】
But, we haven't been able to clarify the structure or outbreak conditions for the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D36)
【至】
During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send mail into the past during the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D46)
【倫太郎】
We haven't succeeded a second time yet, but that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge, that is, electrons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
【倫太郎】
And only when it occurs does the path to the singular point open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
【紅莉栖】
We don't know the cause of the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
【倫太郎】
That's what we're going to examine now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【紅莉栖】
In the first place, the mails we're sending into the past are digital data, no physical objects. That's a definite difference from SERN's time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D96)
【倫太郎】
No, what they do is the same. Who's to say that digital data can't go through a singular point? I'd think it would be easier than something human sized going through.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA6)
【紅莉栖】
Well... that's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB6)

You know, I think it's confusing how you say 'mail'-

It's actually a light beam. Like optical digital data.

Then, let's decide on D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036FE)
Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction.

Wait, when did Mayuri become the speaker?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003772)
【至】
So, why does the D-mail phenomenon occur?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003782)
【倫太郎】
Because the path of the ring singularity opens. I've said so before, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003792)
【紅莉栖】
We haven't confirmed whether or not black holes are formed. It could simply resemble SERN's time machine by coincidence, and be some entirely different phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A2)
【紅莉栖】
It's dangerous to rush to conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B2)
【倫太郎】
What are you saying? Don't you want us to make our own time machine? That's why we so bravely hacked into SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C2)
【倫太郎】
What we should be talking about is how we can make the Microwave Ophone (Temp) usable as a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D2)
【至】
But-, do you think we can do it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FC)

I don't -think- we can do it. We will do it!

What's with that spiritual supremacy doctrine? Are you an incompetent boss or something?

Tch, damn you.... You dare say those remarks about the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma...
<END>

【至】
Well, it's not like Okarin's a boss anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000383C)
【倫太郎】
Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not a boss.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384C)
【紅莉栖】
I don't know what you mean by symbol, but how are you going to use the Microwave Ophone as a time machine? Tell me your concrete solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003876)
【倫太郎】
Solution, huh.... Right, there is one thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003886)
【倫太郎】
We've been thinking it's random whether or not the discharge phenomenon occurs, but I have a hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003896)
【紅莉栖】
What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038A6)
I look at my watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038B6)
It's past noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038C6)
【倫太郎】
Reproduce the occurrence conditions, Christina. Last night, we did a lot of investigation. And then, we overlooked the simplest, most concrete 'condition'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D6)
【倫太郎】
That is, the time of occurrence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E6)
【紅莉栖】
...ah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F6)
【倫太郎】
I checked the times of we the two occurrences of the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003906)
【倫太郎】
And accordingly, when I accidentally sent the first D-mail to Daru's phone, it was somewhere around 12 and 13 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003916)
【倫太郎】
Then the second time, when all four of us observed the D-mail, it was 18 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003926)
【倫太郎】
So basically, if we experiment within those two times, we can possibly reproduce the effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003936)
【紅莉栖】
Let's try immediately...!

At any rate, this assistant sure is in high spirits.

Mayushii's banana supply has gone down-. I gotta buy more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACC)
Only one safe banana remains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADC)
We ate the rest after the other experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AEC)
Not a single gelified banana remains on the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B34)
【紅莉栖】
Sorry, Mayuri-san. I'll go buy you some new bananas later.
<END>

【まゆり】
Really? That makes me happy-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B68)
【まゆり】
You know, Okarin and daru-kun just eat my bananas, but they never pay for them....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B78)
I'll be sure to amend that in the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B88)
If it's to bring chaos to the world, a bunch of bananas is a small price to pay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF6)
Kurisu picks the banana off the bunch, leans under the table, and places it inside the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C06)
【紅莉栖】
First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D2A)

Agh...!

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D3A)
She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.

Quit the clumsy girl appeal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E20)
【紅莉栖】
It was an accident!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E30)
Blushing in embarrassment, Kurisu gets up. She appeals with teary eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E40)
【紅莉栖】
Do something about the microwave's placement. It's dangerous, and annoying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E50)
【倫太郎】
It made a hole in the floor, so we can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E98)
【まゆり】
Chris-chan, Chris-chan, pain, pain, go away-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA8)
Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu's head, grandly waving her hand to the sky.

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC2)
【紅莉栖】
Thanks, Mayuri-san....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEA)
Kurisu pulls herself together, types on the phone, and activates the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EFA)
The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin in reverse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0A)
The 120 on the timer's display gradually decreases.

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F52)

Ah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F62)
Peeping into the microwave, Kurisu raises her voice in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F72)
The banana teleported.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FEE)
It instantly returned from the microwave to the bunch, becoming a jellyman.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004064)

Ohh-

#WRITE(PTR, $00004074)

It became a gelbana, huh-

#WRITE(PTR, $00004084)
【倫太郎】
Heh, heheheh... fuhahaha, fuuhahahaha! Just as I suspected, the occurrence condition was 'time'!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004094)
I was half anxious in my innermost thoughts, but I'm relieved things went well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A4)
I gloriously outwitted the impertinent genius girl. With this, I've secured my position in the lab-- as its symbol.

【紅莉栖】
W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn't notice it.

#WRITE(PTR, $000040DC)
Kurisu says that with a slightly sulky expression.

#WRITE(PTR, $000040EC)
【倫太郎】
Is it vexing? But still, I appreciate your words of praise. Fuhahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004106)
【紅莉栖】
More importantly, lets see if we can reproduce D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004122)
Kurisu ignores my proud laughter and excitedly starts typing out a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004132)
【倫太郎】
Tch, Hououin Kyouma's dignity is dropping thanks to Christina....
<END>

I don't think you had any dignity to begin with.

#WRITE(PTR, $000041C2)
【紅莉栖】
Whatever, just help me, you two. Okabe, I'm sending a mail to your phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041D2)
It's like she's pushing us around....

#WRITE(PTR, $000041F2)
While grinding my teeth, I insert my phone into the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s slot.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004242)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey, Chris-chan, what are you sending-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004252)
Mayuri peeks at Kurisu's phone, almost hugging her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004262)
【紅莉栖】
It doesn't really have to mean anything. We just need to confirm whether or not we can send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004272)
【まゆり】
Hmm? Lemme see here, Okabe wazu un airhe...?
<END>

Wait. Assistant over there, what are you typing?
<END>

【紅莉栖】
Who knows? Ready? I'm sending it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B8)
Daru already operated the microwave's timer through the X68000. Nothing's inside, but the microwave still operates. The countdown starts from 120.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004318)
Now's where the timing counts.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004328)
We have to suddenly open the microwave door while it's operating, but we've yet to verify the timing of sending the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004338)
With that said, we'll do them simultaneously for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004348)
Kurisu readies her finger on her phone's send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004358)
I firmly grasp the microwave door's handle.

3, 2, 1... zero.

#WRITE(PTR, $000043A8)
Almost simultaneously, Kurisu sends the mail.

Light flashes across the room.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000465E)
The cushioning underneath the Microwave Ophone (Temp) collapses under the weight.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000466E)
The floor starts creaking.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000467E)
Exactly like the discharge phenomenon that occurred before──！

#WRITE(PTR, $0000470C)
The discharge phenomenon itself ended in a few dozen seconds.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000471C)
Everybody looks at the Microwave Ophone (Temp) underneath the table with bated breath.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000472C)
Luckily, it didn't break through the floor. That's a relief.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004774)
【紅莉栖】
...Did the mail arrive?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004846)
I disconnect my phone from the Microwave Ophone (Temp), and check my mail.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004856)
Kurisu peeks at my phone screen from the side.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A9E)
I received some mail in English.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AAE)
Two mails.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AD8)

Pfft...

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AE8)
Kurisu wrote that mail herself, yet she starts laughing when she sees it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AF8)
The Ｏｋａｂｅ in the first one is clearly my name.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C20)
But what does ａｉｒｈｅａｄ in the second one mean? Atmospheric skull?

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C30)
I don't quite understand what it means, but I do understand this.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C40)
My assistant is making fun of me.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C56)
No, that doesn't matter right now.

Eh? No. I only sent one.

Mayushii saw too-. You know, she only sent one.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CF2)
【紅莉栖】
That's true.... It was one sentence, but it got divided.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D02)

By the way, what does this sentence mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D1C)

Why don't you look it up yourself?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D2C)
Doesn't look like she wants to answer.

That reminds me, the D-mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too.

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DFC)
【倫太郎】
Was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E1A)

Yeah. Look at your arrival history. I'm pretty sure I sent 'Okarin's a HENTAI'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054B8)
【倫太郎】
It certainly is cut up into two as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005500)
【紅莉栖】
I wonder what the cause could be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005510)
【倫太郎】
It could be related to jellymen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005558)
【まゆり】
But, but, you know, Mayushii's more concerned about why it arrived five days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005568)
【紅莉栖】
That's true. Last time we sent one, it arrived five days ago too, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005578)
【倫太郎】
Yeah. It did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055C0)
【至】
Is it some sort of rule then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055DA)
【まゆり】
Then, then, let's try sending even more-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055EA)
It's just like Mayuri said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055FA)
Now that we've reproduced the discharge phenomenon, as well as D-mail, we should keep experimenting and get as much experimental data as we can.

No, I was just kidding...
