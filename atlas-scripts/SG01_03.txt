#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
Due to it being completely tasteless I plan to change the name into something more refined thus the '(Temp)' part. By the way the one who gave it the 'Microwave Ophone' name was not me but Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
Every time we complete a Future Gadget we hold discussions to decide the name.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)

Mayuri says that she can't remember difficult names. As expected of a simpleton such as her.

I guess this example doesn't make it seem very useful...

However a few days ago we discovered that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) has a strange function which is outside of what we planned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A4)
Our nonchalant girl Mayuri was going to warm up her daily dose of fried food and decided to use the remote control function of the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
Trying to defrost Mayuri's favorite 'Juicy Kara-age Number One!' under such conditions caused a strange event to happen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C4)
In short the fried food 'froze' instead of being warmed up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D4)
It was already in a semi-defrosted condition when it was put in the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E4)
However the attempt to warm it up resulted in it freezing instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F4)
From that time me and Daru have been investigating to find out the cause...

Freezing is basically the act of solidification but the bananas that we experimented on showed the opposite result.
