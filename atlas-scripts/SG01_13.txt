Hmmm.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
I hear a woman's voice from the lounge.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
【紅莉栖？】
That's an interesting experiment you're doing there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
【倫太郎】
W, who's that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2E)
I just felt my heart skip a beat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
Overwhelmed by surprise, I quickly face the direction of the voice...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
... And, I get pierced by a sharp glance aimed right at me.

【倫太郎】
I, Impossible...! Why are you here...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0C)

The genius who had her article published in 'SCIENCE'... The S woman who tortures men in front of an audience... And the one who holds the name of 'The Resurrected One The Zombie'...

Makise Kurisu...!

Nice explanation, bro...

【紅莉栖】
Who are you calling a zombie!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)

What's the meaning of this!? With what purpose did you come here...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)

おかしい、こいつ、なぜ俺の本名を知っている？

I get it... So you're an agent of the organization, and a superhuman, as well...!

【倫太郎】
You are one of the undying...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D24)
【紅莉栖】
I never died. Please don't kill me off, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D34)
【紅莉栖】
Hashida-san, can you do something about this person?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
【至】
He's only panicking since Miss Makise appeared at such a time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
Daru doesn't seem to be perplexed by the appearance of this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
Why, exactly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
【倫太郎】
Daru, did you betray me!?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【至】
Okarin, stop the rampage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA8)
【倫太郎】
Did she get a hold of your weakness? Or were you deceived by her charms?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC4)
I glare at Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD4)
Damn you for doing this to my right hand man...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE4)
【倫太郎】
I won't forgive you, you biiiiitch!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【紅莉栖】
Calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
I think I just saw Makise Kurisu's eyes light up a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
Intensity which you wouldn't expect of an 18 year old.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
Could it be that she didn't die and came back to life, but that she is a man-made machine soldier that replaced the dead Makise Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
Well, I guess I should calm down for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
【紅莉栖】
I found out about this place from Hashida-san after the lecture ended. Your name, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
What a boring truth... I am disappointed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
【倫太郎】
So, you said that you came here to talk to me, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E0)
【紅莉栖】
Yes. I wanted to find out if what you said about me dying was the truth or an excuse for sexual harassment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
Now that she mentions it, she treated me as a pervert yesterday...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001228)
Looking back at it, I really did do something terrible, and it's kind of amazing that she didn't call the cops on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CC)
But it can't be helped. I think that everyone would react in a similar way to seeing a dead person appear right in front of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137A)
【紅莉栖】
I can tell from your current behavior that it was nothing but sexual harassment. Which means that I was right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141E)
【倫太郎】
I'd prefer it if you didn't go to conclusions so quickly. You're misunderstanding me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
If this keeps up, I will be marked as a pervert!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001566)
I must clear up the misunderstanding!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
【紅莉栖】
Well, I will leave that aside for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AE)
【倫太郎】
Eh, you will...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
That's a relief. I thought she was gonna call the police.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F6)
But she also said 'for now'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
With focus and a straight back, Kurisu briskly walks towards the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
Even though she's only 18, she's got quite a nice figure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B34)
The way she walks also looks good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD8)
There's not much around the chest area, though!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7C)
In this cramped space Daru and I falter and try to make some distance away from her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
Kuh, damn you. The development room is off limits for unauthorized people!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E22)
【紅莉栖】
By the way, I don't think I properly introduced myself yet. I am Makise Kurisu. It's nice to meet you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC6)
After saying that, she extents her hand towards me with a sour look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6A)
What is this gesture?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200E)
Is she going to shoot some supernatural waves at me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BC)
【紅莉栖】
You can't even do a handshake? Japanese men sure lack common sense...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002160)
A handshake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002204)
This genius girl who I met only yesterday and who almost marked me a pervert is asking me for a handshake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A8)
【倫太郎】
Westerner!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002356)
【紅莉栖】
I lived in America for 7 years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FA)
【倫太郎】
Westerner...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A8)
Thin, supple, lovely fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254C)
Healthy, elegant and real fingernails with no unnecessary manicures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F0)
I fix my gaze on that beauty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002694)
While standing in a ready-to-run position, I slowly extend my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002738)
I lightly grab the tip of Kurisu's index finger with my own thumb and index finger, and instantly let go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E6)
【紅莉栖】
You're shaking too much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288A)
【倫太郎】
I can feel your killing intent. This is commonly referred to as martial arts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
【紅莉栖】
No, it is not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D2)
【倫太郎】
Then it's NINJA--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A80)
【紅莉栖】
I'm telling you it isn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B24)
Kuh, this woman is completely cool-headed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC8)
Though, her way of speaking becomes scary sometimes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6C)
【倫太郎】
If you grew up in America, you should be asking for a handshake while smiling and saying 'HAHAHA! NICE TOO MEET YOU!'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D10)
【倫太郎】
No, a hug would be more American.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DB4)
Is it not possible for man-made machine soldiers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E62)
【紅莉栖】
Just how narrow-minded are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F06)
Kurisu says that while shrugging.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FB6)
She already turned her eyes away from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000305A)
Now, her gaze is aimed at the banana bunch next to the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FE)
Specifically, the banana which was part of a ridiculous phenomenon that happened just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A2)
The only one in the bunch which is gelified.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327E)
【紅莉栖】
... This is truly interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003322)
Bringing her face close to it, Kurisu is taking a thorough observation of the banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033C6)
【紅莉栖】
Do you have tweezers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000346A)
【倫太郎】
No!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000350E)
【紅莉栖】
Right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035B2)
Kurisu pierces the gelatinous banana with her lovely index finger.p
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003656)
She buries her it deep inside the soft and flabby banana.p
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036FA)
【倫太郎】
What are you doing!? That's valuable experimental data...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A8)
【紅莉栖】
It's mushy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384C)
Kurisu quickly pulls out the finger. Some of the gelatinous substance is left on the tip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F0)
Without any hesitation vacillation, she puts it into her mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003994)
【紅莉栖】
... No taste, huh? Eww.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A38)
She says that with a straight face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADC)
【倫太郎】
You have the appetite of a child, resurrected one. If you're so hungry, then I will give you a single banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B8A)
【紅莉栖】
No, thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C66)
【至】
Either way, those bananas belong to Mayushi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D0A)
【倫太郎】
No need to restrain yourself. I am telling you that I'll give you one!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB8)
【紅莉栖】
As if I'd eat a pervert's banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F66)
【至】
A pervert's banana...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004010)
Daru's body shakes as if he just got an electric shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B4)
W, what? What's with him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004158)
【至】
Eating, a pervert's banana... Mushy... Finger... Eww, and a sour look...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041FC)
Looks like his intracranial pervert processor started working at the highest speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B6)
【至】
Miss Makise, Miss Makise. Could you say that one more time? With a scowl, if possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004364)
【紅莉栖】
What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004408)
【至】
Come on, say 'As if I'd eat a pervert's banana.', and it'd be good if you can add 'Aah, but...' afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B6)
【紅莉栖】
... Hm? ... Hmm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004564)
【紅莉栖】
...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004608)
Kurisu's face reddens as she seems to have finally realized the meaning of the words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046AC)
【倫太郎】
Fwahaha, Daru, you may be hopeless garbage and a disgusting pervert, but I want to say that what you did just now is awesome!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004750)
This is my first win against her!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F4)
I must continue even further and make a nice combo attack!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004898)
Let's show this conceited little girl how adults fight!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000493C)
【倫太郎】
So, Makise Kurisu. What did you imagine just now? Please, don't hesitate in telling us, fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049EA)
【紅莉栖】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A8E)
【倫太郎】
Come on, say it, girl genius! Let us hear the thoughts of a prodigy such as yourself!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B3C)
【紅莉栖】
You, idiot...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BEC)
Perking up her shoulders, Kurisu faces away from us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C90)
Looks like she does have human-like emotions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D34)
I guess that crosses out her being a man-made machine soldier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DD8)
Right now, I feel very refreshed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E7C)
This is probably one of the best feelings I've felt these past few years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F20)
As expected of my right hand man Daru. He's done an excellent job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FFC)
【紅莉栖】
So, both of you are perverts...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050AA)
【至】
Well, I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000514E)
Don't blush, you idiot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051F2)
【倫太郎】
I don't want to have you calling me that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052A0)
【紅莉栖】
Okay. I apologize for my upstart behavior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005344)
Kurisu deeply sighs and faces us again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053E8)
Her facial expression is calm and collected again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005496)
【紅莉栖】
Even though the cause of that was your sexual harassment, I will ignore that for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000553A)
Will you stop saying 'for now'? It worries me that you might call the cops on me afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055DE)
【紅莉栖】
I want you to explain it to me in detail. About this banana, and about this--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056CE)
Kurisu throws a glance at the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005772)
【紅莉栖】
Microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005816)
【倫太郎】
It's top secret. Though, if I were to tell an outsider like you just one thing, I will tell you that the name of this thing is 'Microwave Ophone (Temp)'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000593A)
【紅莉栖】
(Temp)? What does that mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059DE)
【倫太郎】
Exactly what it says. The name is still temporary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A8C)
【紅莉栖】
I don't care about the name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B30)
【倫太郎】
But the name is the only thing I can tell you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BDE)
【至】
But, Okarin. Miss Makise might be able to explain this weird function, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C82)
【倫太郎】
Hm, that's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D26)
Well, Kurisu IS a genius...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DCA)
A genius to the extent of being able to win against me in an argument.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E6E)
But, I really can't stomach her impudent attitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F12)
This girl is too dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FB6)
... And scary, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000605A)
I thought of a good idea just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006108)
【紅莉栖】
You have a stupid grin on your face... Are you thinking something perverted again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000061EC)
【倫太郎】
You said your name was Christina, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000629A)
【紅莉栖】
Who are you calling Christina!? I never said that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000633E)
It sounds like something from a Hollywood movie, so I thought it fits the atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063E2)

If you want to know the secrets behind this microwave oven, there are conditions which you must meet.

... What are they?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006534)

Condition #1. You must become a lab mem.

'Lab mem', you fool! Laboratory member!

You want me to become member of your research facility? I am planning to return to America in August, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067CE)

I will have you write an oath in which you will promise to never expose our secrets to outsiders. If you break that promise, I will report to the 'SCIENCE' magazine that you're a lewd pervert.

Kuh...

You're a demon, Okarin. I'd buy 5 copies of that magazine if it came out.

From the moment you become a lab mem, I will use your brain until you go back to your country.

【紅莉栖】
... That pride is annoying. Okay then, show me the contract.
<END>

There's no such thing! This is a circle, not a company.
<END>

... If I only have to give you my knowledge, then OK. But, if there are any perverted conditions, then the answer is NO.

【倫太郎】
There aren't any, so calm down.

Sexual harassment, then?

I'm telling you, I'm not gonna do that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E8E)

Recently, you said 'Condition #1', right? Then, there must be other conditions, as well. It's fully possible that it's something perverted--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006F32)
【倫太郎】
Condition #2 is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006FD6)

That you will ignore all of the sexual harassment that I did up until now.

Okarin, you're so small! A very small person! That's something mesmerizing and admirable!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007204)

I don't want you to tell me that. By the way, Daru's sexual harassment is not included in condition #2. You talk that out amongst yourselves.

【至】
What? Are you fucking kidding me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007362)

Those are the only 2 conditions! If you don't accept them, then I politely ask you to leave!

For you, that is.

Stop adding 'tina'! I am Kurisu!

As if to make herself calm down, she looks up at the ceiling.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000789E)
Does Kurisu react like that because she grew up in America?

Ahh! Also, 'pervert' is forbidden! I will also stop treating you as one! So let it go already!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A58)

If you understand, then it's alright. Let's go back to the real issue at hand. Daru, explain Christina--

【紅莉栖】
'tina' is also forbidden.

Explain Kurisu-kun all about the experiments we've conducted up until now.

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007B5C)
In the end, I had to be the one to explain it all. When I tried to do my usual displays, she told me to 'stop derailing', so I spoke about the Microwave Ophone's (Temp) and the banana's relationship without a shred of falsehood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007B6C)
As expected of a genius, she didn't ask a single question.

Let's hear your opinion.

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C48)
【紅莉栖】
At the very least, I am quite sure we can dump worthless theories like electromagnetic wave weaponry or teleportation.

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C58)
This Madame sure is belligerent.

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C72)
【紅莉栖】
Can we do the experiment again? I want to see this happen with my own eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C8E)
After saying that, she picks a normal banana from the bunch without even waiting for our approval.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C9E)
With a serious look on her face, she puts the banana in the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and uses her own phone to start it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CAE)
I wonder why.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CBE)
While gazing at her, I think that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CCE)
She looks like she's having fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CDE)
Even though she always has a sour look on her face, I thought that for some unknown reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CEE)
Well, since she's a splendid scholar in the making, it's not weird if she's also an experiment-loving girl.
<END>

【紅莉栖】
Okabe-san and Hashida-san, please look at the banana bunch.

I'd like it if you didn't give me orders. I am the mad scientist Houou--

Whatever, just don't look away from them!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007D9E)
Instant anger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007DF2)
Just like we were told, we stare at the bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E02)
We'd be looking at them even if she didn't order us, since we neglected to do so the first time the 'teleportation' happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E1C)
【紅莉栖】
60 seconds have passed. Any change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E36)
【至】
Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E46)
Right now, the banana should become gelified and return to the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E56)
If a phenomenon happens once, we can call it an accident or an unexpected byproduct, but if it happens twice, then we can say that something is 'actually happening'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E66)
If it happens now, Kurisu will probably rethink some things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E76)
Then, she might agree that this is the first successful teleportation experiment in human history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E86)
As if praying, I keep staring at the banana--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E96)

100 seconds.

Ah!

#WRITE(PTR, $0000805C)
Out of nowhere, a gelbana 'appeared' without any sound.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000806C)
There are now 2 of them in the bunch.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000807C)
It happened in an instant shorter than the blink of an eye.

It appeared!

#WRITE(PTR, $0000809C)

#WRITE(PTR, $000080AC)
The impact is enough to make me lose my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080BC)
Just now, I saw something unbelievable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080CC)
An obvious teleportation phenomenon.

With a hard expression, Kurisu is looking inside the microwave oven.

#WRITE(PTR, $00008124)
【倫太郎】
What happened on your side?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000813E)
【紅莉栖】
Eh? Uh, ehmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000814E)
【紅莉栖】
A, after 104 seconds, have passed, it, it disappeared. Instantly, yes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000815E)
She's slightly panicking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000816E)
There are only a few people that wouldn't be surprised by such a phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000817E)
【倫太郎】
This is an actual teleport. The first one in human history!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008198)

...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081A8)
Kurisu quickly becomes calm.

#WRITE(PTR, $000081B8)
She starts thinking after wrinkling up her eyebrows and folding her arms...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081C8)
Raising the tiptoe of her right foot up and down...

#WRITE(PTR, $000081D8)
Mumbling something in a whisper...

Instant movement... Is that, really possible...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081F8)
【紅莉栖】
But it actually happened... No matter how unbelievable that is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000821A)

Is it <DICT>quantum teleportation</DICT>...? No no, that's about the quantum level...

【倫太郎】
Don't avert your eyes from the truth. What you just saw is the everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008244)
To these words of mine, Kurisu responds with a sharp look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008254)
Those eyes are like those of a sniper.

#WRITE(PTR, $00008264)
Her fighting spirit is not to be underestimated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008274)
【紅莉栖】
... Is it really a teleport? It's dangerous to start with the conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008284)
【倫太郎】
Well then, girl genius, what would you call this phenomenon?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000829E)
【紅莉栖】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000082EE)
【紅莉栖】
Let's look it over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000082FE)
【紅莉栖】
The bunch of bananas and the frozen fried food didn't teleport, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000830E)
【倫太郎】
... So, there might be limits to the size of the object which can teleport.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000831E)
【紅莉栖】
But fried chicken is smaller than bananas, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000832E)
【倫太郎】
For all experiments we used the same 12-in-1 pack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000833E)
Mayuri doesn't buy anything besides 'Juicy Kara-age Number One!'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008386)
【至】
That's quite a large amount.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083AC)
【紅莉栖】
What about salt? You said you experimented with it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083BC)
One time, we tried this experiment with a handful of table salt placed on a plate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083CC)
The result was that nothing happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083E6)
【紅莉栖】
The plate was in the way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083F6)
【倫太郎】
We tried without it, as well, but nothing changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008410)
【紅莉栖】
Then, does this mean that the grains of salt are too small for something to happen...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000842A)
【紅莉栖】
Hmm... I need a clue...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000843A)
Looks like our girl genius is fighting a hard battle. She's aimlessly wandering around the room while looking really irritated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000844A)
【紅莉栖】
Any others? Are there any other things you found out that are related to the Microwave Ophone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000845A)
【倫太郎】
It's not Microwave Ophone, but Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008474)
【紅莉栖】
That doesn't matter at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008484)
【紅莉栖】
So? Is there anything you know about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008494)
Kurisu askingly looks not at me, but at Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084A4)
He's the one who did all the maintenance of the Microwave Ophone (Temp), so he should know more about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084EC)

Ah, right--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084FC)
Daru timidly opens his mouth.

This one time, this thing did a great electrical discharge.

【倫太郎】
What!? That's the first time I heard of that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008540)
【至】
It happened when you weren't in.

#WRITE(PTR, $00008550)
【紅莉栖】
How powerful was the discharge?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008560)

It was like a fluorescent lamp was lit up. It continued for like 2 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008570)
【紅莉栖】
What was the situation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008580)
【至】
I was tuning the cellphone which is attached to it. I took it out and replaced it with my own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008590)
【至】
And a short time after I did that... Sparky sparks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085A0)
【倫太郎】
When did that happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085BA)
【至】
Yesterday's noon. When Okarin went to see Dr. Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085D4)
【紅莉栖】
Dr. Nakabachi...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085E4)
That's right, yesterday I went to see Dr. Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085F4)
Speaking of which, the time travel theory that he spoke was all a John Titor rip-off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000860C)
It could be that Nakabachi is one of the <DICT>inside people</DICT> of the John Titor that's posting on the boards right now
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000861C)
【倫太郎】
But wait. Daru, you said that Dr. Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000862C)
【至】
Yes. But Okarin, you still went there along with Mayushi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000863C)
... I don't have such memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000864C)
What I remember is that Nakabachi's presentation was never cancelled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000865C)
My memories are still inconsistent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000866C)
【倫太郎】
Speaking of which, I sent Daru a mail. Did it reach you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000867C)
【至】
What mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008696)
【紅莉栖】
The one that you showed me yesterday in ATF?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000086A6)
After I nod, Kurisu comes closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000086F6)
【紅莉栖】
If I remember correctly, it said that in that presentation I was stabbed by a man and died, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008706)
【倫太郎】
Yeah. For some reason, it reached Daru's phone a week in the past...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000874E)

Huh? But that was a lie, wasn't it? If it wasn't, then the time stamp wouldn't be weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000875E)
【倫太郎】
I always speak the truth! If you don't believe me, then I'll show you my transmission history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000877A)
I take out my phone and look through my sent messages.

But--

#WRITE(PTR, $0000879A)

Not here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087AA)
There are no traces of that mail in my history.

I clearly remember what happened about 30 minutes after Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087CA)
After seeing the dead Kurisu, me and the ~10 other people with me started panicking and left the Radio Center in a rush. I sent the mail after that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087DA)
No matter how hard I search, I can't find the record of the mail I sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087EA)

#WRITE(PTR, $000087FA)
Just like the banana inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).

Why isn't it here...? I'm sure I sent it at about 1'o clock yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008852)

Ah, it was about that time that the electrical discharge happened! 'It's Okay to Laugh!' was just about to end.

#WRITE(PTR, $00008862)
That moment, it occurred to me.

#WRITE(PTR, $00008872)
Just like Edison wanted, I got the 1% of inspiration. I am truly a genius!

With a broad grin, I look over Daru and Kurisu.

I get it... So that's how it was.

#WRITE(PTR, $000088DA)
【紅莉栖】
Eh, what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000088F4)
【至】
Ah, this is one of Okarin's weird habits, so I think it's better to ignore it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008904)
【倫太郎】
Silence! I finally got it! I finally understand it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008966)
I repeatedly hit the top of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) with the palm of my hand.

The mail that I've sent and the weird electrical discharge phenomenon--

I understand that they're somehow related, but how?

It's your job to find that out, Christina.

If we repeat the electrical discharge, then the time-stamp of a mail should become weird.

Daru, explain in detail the state of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) when the electrical discharge occurred.
<END>

It was in quite a ridiculous state. My cellphone was connected to it, and I was testing if it was possible to control it with the X68000 X68k.

Whatever, just send a mail to my phone already!

If these are the right conditions, then sending an email to my phone connected to the Microwave Ophone (Temp) would cause the time-stamp of that mail be the past, not the present.

My assistant shrugs with a sullen face.

Why me!?

C'mon now. Why are you always experimenting on Mayushii's food?

Mayuri puts her hand on the door--

Hey, wait, don't open it, Mayuri!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000094FE)

Huh?

While tilting her head, she opens it--

【まゆり】
Wha-wha!

#WRITE(PTR, $00009716)
In the dimly lit development room, a blueish-white light akin to lightning appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009798)
【紅莉栖】
An electrical discharge!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000097EC)
The violent sound of sparks.

#WRITE(PTR, $00009834)
I grab Mayuri's body and move her a step away from the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009852)

Is, isn't this bad!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009AFC)
A faint smoke starts spreading out across the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B0C)
I smell something burning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B1C)
From the flashes of light, my eyes are a bit paralyzed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B2C)
I repeatedly blink in an attempt to restore my eyesight.

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B3C)
I hear Kurisu and Daru coughing.

Are you all okay?

S, somewhat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B6C)
【紅莉栖】
Hey, are you sure that the discharge was only about 2 seconds?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B7C)
Mayuri strongly grabs my upper arm with her thin fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B8C)
【まゆり】
O, Okarin? Ehmm, what just happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009C80)
My vision gradually returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009C90)
Mayuri looks very perplexed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CA0)
【倫太郎】
Are you okay? No burns or anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CB0)
【まゆり】
Nah... It doesn't hurt anywhere, so I think I'm okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CC0)
Looks like I was right to protect Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CD0)
As an insane mad scientist, I must protect my comrades from danger, even if I have to use my own body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CE0)
I let go of Mayuri's body, which I have been holding tight until now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CF0)
Ahh... This was quite an event.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D00)
I wipe the sweat off my forehead.

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D1A)
【紅莉栖】
W, wait, look at this!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D2A)
Kurisu's voice is tense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DB8)
After my vision returned, I go back into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DC8)
The sight in front of me makes me lose my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DE4)
The large table in the middle of this room. Made of wood and sturdy enough to hold 5 or 6 people. The table which supported the Microwave Ophone and the X68000...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DF4)
... Is split right into two.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E04)
Everything that was on the table is now on the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E14)
And--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E24)
The vital part - the microwave--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E92)
Is piercing through the broken table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EA2)
It has literally penetrated the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EB2)
【至】
What the hell? How...? Even if it is a microwave, it's not heavy enough to open up a hole in the floor...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EC2)
【紅莉栖】
An electrical discharge cannot do this. What other phenomena...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009ED2)
I was lost for words until now, but the seriousness of the situation made me open my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F40)
【倫太郎】
Ku, kukuku, fuahahaha! E, everything is just as planned!

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F50)
For now, a loud laugh.

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F60)
Then, I attempt to take out the cellphone and do the usual, but unfortunately, it's in the Microwave Ophone.

El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A00E)
Without actually saying anything, I lip those words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A01E)
They have no meaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A02E)
I only use them because I like their 'feeling'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A03E)
However, since they lack a meaning, they can eventually get one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A04E)
Due to the many years of saying them, I can now calm my heart and mind just by mumbling them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A0E6)

... So, about that Mayushi's fried chicken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A12E)
【まゆり】
Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A19C)
After standing up, Mayuri slowly looks at the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1AC)
The microwave is on the floor, and the door is completely open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1BC)
【まゆり】
Aah, Mayushii's fried chicken is all black...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1CC)
Since she looks downhearted, I gently hit her shoulders to cheer her up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1DC)

Juicy Karaage Number One became a noble sacrifice for the sake of the success of a grand experiment. Let us pray for it's happiness in the next world.

Hey! Hououin Kyouma, do something about this! Mayushii-san wrongly remembers my name!
