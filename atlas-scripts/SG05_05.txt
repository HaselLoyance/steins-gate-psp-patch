After Kurisu and Daru go back, only Mayuri is left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000230)
I thought she was working hard at making her costumes, but she's spacing out without moving her hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000240)
【倫太郎】
Mayuri? You're not going home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000250)
Usually, she would've gone home long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000260)
If she doesn't hurry home, her parents will probably worry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000027A)
【まゆり】
Well, I just remembered what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000294)
【まゆり】
And when I remembered, I tried my best to somehow figure it out, but it was no good. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AE)
【まゆり】
But, what I do kinda understand, is that things are going to get amazing, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BE)
【倫太郎】
Indeed. Humanity will advance towards a new stage. And our lab will be its guiding torch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D8)
【まゆり】
How dazzling-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
【倫太郎】
Dazzling? What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F8)
【まゆり】
Okarin and Chris-chan are so sparkly and shiny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000308)
【倫太郎】
That's probably my, Hououin Kyouma's, aura of insanity. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000322)
【まゆり】
You know, it's already been about 10 days since Chris-chan joined us, right? Can Mayushii say what she's been feeling those days?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000332)
【まゆり】
When Chris-chan became a lab mem, it kinda seemed like the lab's atmosphere snapped and tightened-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000342)
Amen to that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000352)
【倫太郎】
Hm. I have to admit that one. She certainly does have an intense wealth of knowledge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000362)
【倫太郎】
And I cannot help but say that winning over such a genius girl as a comrade was yet another of my, Hououin Kyouma's, magnificent achievements!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000372)
【まゆり】
That's why you're dazzling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000382)
【まゆり】
Chris-chan is really a big help to the lab and Okarin, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039C)
【まゆり】
But you know, Mayushii's not really that much of a help to Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AC)
Mayuri looks depressed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BC)
【まゆり】
If only Mayushii were smarter too-. Because then, she could be helpful to Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CC)
【倫太郎】
Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DC)
She's never said anything like this before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EC)
Perhaps, is she jealous of Kurisu's ability?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FC)
Is competition brewing in the lab...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000423)
I sigh and walk up to the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AC)
Even if I look up from here, I can't see many stars in the night sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BC)
【倫太郎】
Mayuri, are the stars not visible today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CC)
When I call out like that, Mayuri comes up beside me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DC)
We both lean out the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EC)
It's still before 9PM, but the area's already become still and silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FC)
All we hear is the occasional car.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050C)
【まゆり】
Back when the lab was just formed... back even before Daru-kun was here, the two of us often spent time silently like this, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000051C)
【倫太郎】
Yeah, we did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052C)
Daru became a lab mem at the start of Golden Week in May.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000053C)
Before that, he was unwilling no matter how much I persuaded him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000054C)
But as soon as he learned that the lab was located just a three minutes walk from MayQueen+Nyan², he flip-flopped and said "Actually, I've always wanted to be part of the Future Gadget Laboratory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000055C)
So, for about one and a half months after this Future Gadget Laboratory was established, Mayuri and I were alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A4)
【まゆり】
Is it okay if Mayushii stays here from now on too-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B4)
Mayuri stops looking up at the night sky and looks to me with a questioning gaze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C4)
I take that gaze head on and boop Mayuri on the head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D4)
【倫太郎】
Don't say such trivial things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E4)
【倫太郎】
All Mayuri has to do is stay here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
【まゆり】
Just stay...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000604)
【倫太郎】
If you weren't around, the lab would probably be more bloodthirsty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000614)
【倫太郎】
Especially with me and Assistant, since we're like water and oil. It wouldn't be strange if our conflicting viewpoints sparked a fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000624)
【倫太郎】
But then, at that point, Mayuri, unable to read the atmosphere, would fire off an optimistic comment and neutralize the bloodthirst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063E)
【まゆり】
Hmmm? Are you praising me-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064E)
【倫太郎】
Of course I'm praising you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065E)
【倫太郎】
Don't worry about a thing. After all, your being here is all according to my plan. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000678)
【まゆり】
I see-. Thank you, Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000688)
Mayuri smiles in relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A4)
And then her tummy rumbles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BE)
【まゆり】
I'm so hungry-. I'll go warm up some oden. Okarin, you want some too-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CE)
【倫太郎】
Yeah. Please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DE)
【まゆり】
Okay then, please wait a bit-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
Afterwards, the two of us eat the oden while huffing.
<FILEEND12>
