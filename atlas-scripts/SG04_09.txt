Luka shyly visits the lab the same way he did yesterday.

Luka-shi's girl version... will definitely be moe.

Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are already on standby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000722)
Sending a D-mail to a pager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000732)
Yesterday, we argued whether or not that's possible, and eventually settled that it'll probably be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000742)
We're still just sending data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000752)
The rest depends on the pager radio wave stations 18 years ago, but it should be fine as long as our data gets through safely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000762)
We already googled how to send data to a pager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000772)
Using a contemporary pager, you would first enter the other person's pager number, then, if in the Kanto region, enter *2*2.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000782)
And then after that, you would enter in numbers which would be displayed on the other person's tiny LCD. It seems like that's how it works.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
Contemporary pagers in 1992 could still only send numbers. And since number display functions were also not yet implemented, the other person would automatically be unable to see your number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
A few years after that, pagers started to implement katakana and then kanji displays, making them not too dissimilar to current cellphone mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B2)
Therefore, the D-mail Lukako's about to send-- it's technically not a mail, though-- has to be sent in numerical form.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C2)
Of course, I have a conversion table for that at hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D2)
You can even find information from 18 years ago if you just google it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E2)
I was quite irritated that information on pagers was fairly scarce, but that's my little secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
【紅莉栖】
Urushibara-san, you yourself need to think about what text to send to your mother in the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
【るか】
Eh...? I do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8C)
【倫太郎】
If you want to grant your own wish, then you should clear your own path to it. We are merely your outriders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
【るか】
Understood....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
We explain to Lukako the function of the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C78)
The numbers we're sending are half-width, so we can send 36 of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
The pager's number → letter conversion uses two numbers to correspond to one hiragana character.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
Furthermore, since you first need to input *2*2, that means you can only send 16 hiragana characters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E64)
Lukako understands everything and takes out a notebook, writing drafts of the pager message.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
I showed Lukako the site I found.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F4)
Pager typing is commonly known as two touch typing or pager input.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
Cellphone operation differs somewhat, where you choose the consonant and then input the vowel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
The consonants are A Ka Sa Ta Na Ha Ma Ya Ra Wa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E0)
The vowels are ａ, ｉ, ｕ, ｅ, ｏ.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
Basically, to input Ke,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
You'd press 2 to input the consonant Ka,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CC)
Next, you'd press 4 for the vowel e.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)

This is pretty annoying. I think if you typed '831831831'... then that would be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C4)
【まゆり】
Why 831-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
【至】
831 for "Ya Sa I", durr. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES-- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi's mother's brain

She'd just end up treating that message like a prank.

Then, then, how about '29292929'?

I'll hear you out, but what does that mean?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
【まゆり】
MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA6)
【倫太郎】
Why do you want her to like meat!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4A)
【まゆり】
That's not it-. If you keep repeating 'MEAT Meeaaat-' then instead, I think she'd start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables, don't you think-?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DEA)
【るか】
"MOM EAT VEGGIES OKAY"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E32)
【至】
Isn't that a little too direct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E42)
【倫太郎】
Isn't that first 'MOM' unnecessary? It'll just leave more room for doubt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5C)
【るか】
Then.... "EAT VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A HEALTHY GIRL"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E76)
【紅莉栖】
That's too much of a stretch.... And it's over the character limit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E90)
【るか】
"EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID..."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAA)
【至】
Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for dakuten.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EBA)
【至】
So that sentence is four half width characters over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED4)
【倫太郎】
Then a little modification. How about "EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEE)
【紅莉栖】
Isn't that too informal? You're talking to Urushibara-san's mother, right? Would she understand the 'VEG 4' part?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFE)
【倫太郎】
You have any bright ideas?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1C)
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and says no more.

Looks like it's settled.

Then let's hurry and type it out-

Alright, preparations are A-OK.

Now we just activate the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and have Lukako call.

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FC)
The microwave timer is set to "154152#". With this, it'll reach around January 1, 1993. Measurement error is around 1~3 days, I guess. Leap year calculation's a pain, so I ignored it.

It's scary just imagining it.

I should wait until I can meet with Lukako alone, and check then.

But considering how his appearance didn't change at all, it's very likely that the sex change failed.
