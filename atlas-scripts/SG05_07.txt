We finish our shopping and come out in front of the station.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084E)
【倫太郎】
Oh yeah, Mayuri. Have you not been working at a part time job lately?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
【まゆり】
Job? You mean at 'Lemoine'-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086E)
That's right. In the current Akiba devoid of moe shops, "MayQueen+Nyan²" doesn't exist any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087E)
【まゆり】
Well, it's right before ComiMa, so I'm taking days off-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
【まゆり】
I gotta do give cosplay making my all-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
【倫太郎】
Exactly how many costumes are you making this year?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【まゆり】
Three. Umm, for Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan. And then one for Luka-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1C)
Lukako probably still doesn't want to wear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2C)
Well, of course not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3C)
After all, even though he looks like that, he's still a genuine guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4C)
No, wait. That was before we sent the D-mail. Now she's a genuine girl, I guess. How complicated....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A66)
【まゆり】
Ah..., it's Moeka-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
【倫太郎】
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
I look where Mayuri's pointing to, and see her squatting at the staircase to the station's smoking area, staring at her cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDA)
And she looks awfully serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
There are shadows all around her eyes, and her hair is frayed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
She seems more worn out than the last time I've seen her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
I hesitate to call out to her, feeling an unusual atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
She's ignored me before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
It's quite difficult to deal with that Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
But as a fellow lab mem, I can't just ignore her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
【倫太郎】
You, the masseuse! You seem pretty depressed, don't you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
【まゆり】
Tutturu-, Moeka-san. What are you doing here-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
【萌郁】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
Moeka doesn't look up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
She mutters something, but I can't quite catch it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
【倫太郎】
Hey, are you listening? If you have any worries at all, this insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will splendidly settle them for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
【倫太郎】
That is, if you're prepared to see Akiba become a sea of blood... hehehe
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
Moeka overreacts to my words with a twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE8)
She lifts her head and stares at me with open eyes. Or so I thought. She gets up with a staggering force, drawing closer to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF8)
This is the first time I've seen Moeka express so much emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E08)
【萌郁】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E18)
【倫太郎】
What is it? What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
【萌郁】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
So she can't speak directly after all....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E52)
Moeka hangs her head and starts typing on her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E62)
Looks like she's writing another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F76)
【倫太郎】
What do you mean, what happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F90)
【萌郁】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A4)
【倫太郎】
It's not fully understood yet. We're in the middle of improving it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
【まゆり】
It's amazing-. You know, they say this time, we might be able to time leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【倫太郎】
Don't report it. If you do, we'll have to excommunicate you as a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
Moeka violently shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Seems she won't report it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
【倫太郎】
Through hacking SERN, we discovered another possibility for the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001256)
【倫太郎】
It's a new time travel system made possible by borrowing part of SERN's equipment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
【倫太郎】
This will repaint the history of mankind, advancing it one more step up the ladder. That is, the conquest of the barrier of time. Thus, people won't be washed away by the future, but be able to choose their own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
【倫太郎】
Our Future Gadget Laboratory will soon accomplish that which is unprecedented throughout all of the history of mankind...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001286)
【倫太郎】
Okarin Okarin, that explanation was so roundabout, that you lost Mayushii.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CE)
【まゆり】
「オカリンオカリン、その説明はね、すごく回りくどくて、まゆしぃにはさっぱりなのです」
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DE)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EE)
To be unable to understand my message is to have not a shred of emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
Moeka bites her lip and irritatedly types out a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
She grabs my upper arm and sinks in her fingernails, rather painfully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001334)
【倫太郎】
W-will you let go of me, please....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001344)
But Moeka wouldn't listen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
【倫太郎】
Time leaping, in other words, sending your memories across time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
【倫太郎】
We found a way to make that possible. Before long, we'll actually time leap, and become conquerors of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B0)
【まゆり】
Well, Okarin came up with the idea, Chris-chan said it was possible-, Daru-kun's helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are out shopping-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C0)
【萌郁】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DC)
Moeka absentmindedly lets go of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
She squats down on the spot, just as we had found her-- no, wait, she looks even more powerless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
【まゆり】
Moeka-san? Are you okay? Do you feel bad-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
【萌郁】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
【倫太郎】
I won't say any more than that. There are still several problems left to solve. If we can settle those easily, I guess it'll be complete in a week.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
【倫太郎】
But if we can't settle them, then it won't ever be complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【倫太郎】
Everything is Steins;Gate's choice. I believe that we will surely find the path to settle them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
【倫太郎】
And once the door is opened, what will visit is the chaos I desired. Curtains shall fall on the 'Organization' that rules the world from the shadows at the hands of the Final Crusade"Ragnarok"...！
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
【まゆり】
Okarin, who are you fighting-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
【倫太郎】
They never appear on center stage, but they manipulate the governments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
【まゆり】
Heeh, amazing~. But you shouldn't do anything dangerous, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001690)
Why is Mayuri the one looking out for me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
【萌郁】
hm...hm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Oh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
While sitting, Moeka's lips curl up into a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001712)
【萌郁】
Hmhmhm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172E)
Unlike last time, she gets up sluggishly and staggers off as if she had forgotten about our existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173E)
Mayuri and I could do nothing but see her off once we felt her ghastly atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174E)
【まゆり】
What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175E)
I thought she was a weird girl since I first met her, but....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176E)
Maybe she's a mental patient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177E)
Hehehe, but I'm the most ill of us all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178E)
After all, what I wish for is world chaos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
【倫太郎】
Fuhaha, Fuhahahaha, Foooohahaahahaahahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EE)
【まゆり】
Whaaah? Even Okarin's getting weird-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【まゆり】
Mayushii's worried....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001814)
I stop my loud laughter once I see her about to cry.
