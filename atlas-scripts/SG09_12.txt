#WRITE(PTR, $0000297E)
I grind my teeth.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298E)
I look Kurisu in the eye with a serious look.

I've been fighting up to this point just to reach this Turning Point...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029AE)

From an objective perspective, it hasn't been half an hour since the Time Leap Machine was completed.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B5A)
If I don't, Mayuri will die again.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6A)
And then in 26 years, the world will become ruled by SERN's dystopia.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7A)
Suzuha's efforts to cross through time will have come to nothing.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF4)
Without thinking, I burst out laughing.

Our Sir Supah Hakah (Tsundere) really is reliable.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EA0)
While Daru wires his PC and the IBN 5100, I explain the circumstances to both of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB0)
【倫太郎】
Basically, the origin of everything was the first D-mail I sent to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC0)
【倫太郎】
Since it got logged in SERN's Echelon, the Rounders targeted us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED0)
【倫太郎】
As a result, they kill Mayuri, carry us off to SERN, and steal the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
After several years, Daru and I escape our confinement and form the resistance which Suzuha becomes a member of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF0)
【倫太郎】
It was useless no matter how many times I tried. The world, in accordance with Attractor Field Theory, converged to the same result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F08)

If that was all Okarin's delusion, I think he'd make a great <DICT>light novel</DICT>.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F18)
【倫太郎】
It's the truth. All of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F28)
【倫太郎】
To avoid Mayuri's death──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F38)
And to free Suzuha's future from SERN──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F48)
【倫太郎】
We need to escape from the α World Line. We need to 'cancel' all of the warped events so far. I think it's possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F58)
【倫太郎】
Basically, what we should aim for is where we were before I sent Daru the first D-mail: the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F68)
【倫太郎】
To reach there, we need to take Echelon's stored data of the first d-mail, and erase it from SERN's database.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F78)
Standard Divergence is over 1%.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F88)
Now, if we erase the mail data from SERN's computer, we'll surely achieve that number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
The existence of just one mail data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA8)
That trifling difference becomes a dramatic influence in the future via the Butterfly Effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FC2)

You believe it, Makise-shi?

As a hypothesis. I'd like objective data if possible, but that's obviously unreasonable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003012)
【倫太郎】
Relax. The Time Leap Machine you improved for us was excellent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302C)
【紅莉栖】
Of, of course it was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000303C)
She didn't deny it, but that's just like Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003056)
【紅莉栖】
And you already planned to hack with the IBN 5100 in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003066)
【紅莉栖】
Anyway, go access it, and if the mail data exists, then that's proof what you said is true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003076)
【至】
So basically, 'Don't think, feel, ' huh? I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003090)
【紅莉栖】
No, it might be the opposite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030A0)

It should be 'Don't think, just do.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B0)
Daru, squishing his large body behind the PC to work the wiring, wipes the sweat off his head and sits in the chair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030F8)

Finished the bridging. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about 10 minutes.

Alright.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003122)
【紅莉栖】
At any rate, the first D-mail that became the source, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003132)
【紅莉栖】
It's that isn't it? What you showed me at ATF.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314C)
【紅莉栖】
That I died or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003162)
【倫太郎】
Right. When I witnessed your death at Radio Kaikan, I sent Daru a D-mail explaining that. Daru just happened to be running an experiment on the Microwave Ophone (Temp), so the discharge phenom...en...on─

Now, I felt like I had overlooked something very serious.

#WRITE(PTR, $00003394)
That feeling suddenly brought anxiety to my heart.
