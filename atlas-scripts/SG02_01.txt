That shocking experiment gave me the conviction that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) can function as a time machine.

She never showed her face here again.

So, Daru and I are left in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070E)
Our enthusiasm shot through the roof once we learned that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) was hiding tremendous possibilities, and once we witnessed first-hand a mail sent back into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071E)
So we've been staying up all night doing all sorts of experiments to check if the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is a time machine or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072E)
But the results....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073E)
We bought various things to throw into the Microwave Ophone (Temp), but they all failed. No change. Nothing happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074E)
After the experiment where the discharge phenomenon occurred, everything warmed up normally without gelification.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
The reason why suddenly nothing happened is unknown.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076E)
And about the ability to send mail into the past.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
On top of repeating experiments for now, our current issues are as follows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000842)
<LINE>
Problem 1--<LINE><LINE>
Discharge phenomenon counter-measures.<LINE>Due to the risk of fire, we removed everything flammable from the development room.<LINE>We prepared two fire buckets full of water just in case.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000872)
But that's still not a fundamental solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
We'll have to observe things in the future, but if things get dangerous, we should consider changing the location of the experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000934)
<LINE>
Problem 2--<LINE><LINE>
The problem of mass increase.<LINE>When the discharge phenomenon occurs, the Microwave Ophone (Temp) seems to have a sudden mass increase for unknown reasons.<LINE>Because of this, the microwave broke the table and made a dent in the floor.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F2)
To deal with the issue, we placed the microwave on the floor, spreading cushions and blankets under it. It hides the hole in the floor, so it kills two birds with one stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A02)
It's only a temporary fix, but if we make any more holes in the floor, Mister Braun is quite capable of raising my rent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
That's to say nothing of what disasters it will bring if it falls through the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A22)
By the way, we need to examine why the mass increases. The question is if a group of amateurs like us can do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
So with that said, the above two problems are trivial.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
There's a more serious problems at hand. If we don't solve them, we won't be able to send mail into the past. It's that critical a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0C)
<LINE>
Problem 3--<LINE><LINE>
The conditions to send mail into the past in the first place are unclear.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
No matter how many times we tried, we couldn't specify those conditions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4C)
We stayed up all night repeating trial and error more than 40 times, but not once did the discharge phenomenon reoccur.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
I thought that opening the microwave door was a point, but that line of thought was soon crushed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B78)
There might be some sort of conditions, but for now, we're at a stalemate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B88)
At first, we were in high spirits, but as time progressed, we got more and more frustrated at the experimental failures. And that brings us to the present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
I've honestly gave up, so I spent the entire morning exhausted like this.

They're all from 'Glowing MasseuseShining Finger'-- the woman named Kiryuu Moeka.

I don't normally use mail that often.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
Unlike high school girls nowadays, like Mayuri, I only send about one a day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C42)
With that said, this frequency is a little irritating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
Since Masseuse is a mail demon, I should've expected this. I was careless.

I only faintly remember, but one thing is clear.

Titor left this 'prediction'. That is, before the year 2034, SERN will complete a time machine...!

Ohh, a time machine. That's a timely topic.

But not just 10 years ago, but methinks the current Titor said the same thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
【倫太郎】
10 years ago or now, it doesn't matter. Don't worry about that part, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183E)
【倫太郎】
This strange sign is very likely to be Steins;Gate's choice!

Can we trust this Titor guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)

It doesn't matter if we trust him or not! We are connected to him now my means of the keyword: time machine.

There should be no disadvantage to investigating Titor's reference to SERN!

Suddenly triumphant, Daru lightly taps the keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
He goes to the computer's My Pictures folder and opens a folder seriously called SERN. In that folder, Daru has countless SERN-related images collected from all over the web.

SERN began time machine research in 2001, and in 2034, they complete the time machine.

Daru 'Invading people's heartsDiving' makes you a hungry man, after all.

Daru OK, boss.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E0)
Or something like that. Yup, a really mindnumbingly cool conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288E)
But Daru in reality just tapers his lips.

Okarin, you never fully explain things. Talk so that you can be understood rather than to sound cool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D6)
Dammit, read the atmosphere!

You are a supah hakah.

Don't be stupid. At least say hacker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BCC)

Understand the rest?

No, not at all.

Hack into SERN.

Upon hearing my request, Daru makes an astonished face.

...Is that some sort of joke?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F14)

Daru, I know you can do it. Disclose their dastardly deeds, and procure a hint about the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCA)
【至】
Dastardly deeds...? Okarin, isn't that just your delusion-

We're now at the junction of whether we can use the Microwave Ophone (Temp) as a time machine or whether it will die as garbage in the lab's storage.

You serious?

#WRITE(PTR, $00003010)

I'm always serious!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003020)
I answer as I stare Daru straight in the eye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003030)
Thanks to that, it looks like Daru understand how I feel.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000304C)
Recklessly brushing off the garbage around his computer, Daru sits up in his chair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000305C)
【至】
We don't know how this will turn out, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000306C)
As if his listlessness earlier were a lie, Daru's spine muscles are perfectly stretched out now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307C)

The deal is done. Begin at once.

Uha, let's do this!

I'll deposit your reward of a week's supply of potato chips into your Swiss bank account.

Daru's already concentrating so much that he doesn't seem to hear my last remark.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030CC)
【倫太郎】
Whelp, I'm sleeping. I leave the rest to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000313A)
I lie down on the sofa and sink into sleep with the sound of Daru's typing streaming into my ears.
