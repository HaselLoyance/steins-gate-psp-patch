After I got back to the lab, I took the TV that broke down this noon to the CRT Workshop below us, to have it fixed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
Daru and Mayuri have already went home, so bringing this TV alone through a narrow and steep stairway was back-breaking work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
Opening the door with a hit of my hips, I enter the workshop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000026C)
At this late hour in this dim-lit store, the huge CRT which shows some foreign news program feels awfully bright.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B8)
A 42 CRT TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C8)
I don't think it's possible to get one in Japan these days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D8)
With LCD TVs becoming the standard, I truly doubt that someone would want to come to this shop and buy a CRT.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032C)
【天王寺？】
Oh, what's up, Okabe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033C)
In front of the huge CRT sits a middle-aged muscular delinquent, reading a sports newspaper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
This man is both the owner of the building and the shopkeeper of this establishment, Mister Tennouji Braun Yuugo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EA)
I call him 'Mr Braun'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FA)
That's because he's a weirdo who loves Braun tubes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045E)
【倫太郎】
Don't you give me a 'what's up?'. Your damn TV broke on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000478)
【天王寺】
You brat, did you treat my CRT violently?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000055E)
I barely manage to put the heavy TV on the counter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
【天王寺】
These need to be handled with love, you know. LOVE.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AE)
For such a stern man to talk about something like love...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000752)
That sure sends chills down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
【倫太郎】
I request that you fix it and prioritize it over all your other works.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A4)
【天王寺】
As usual, you're speaking in a stupid way...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000954)
The shopkeeper begins the investigation to find the problem, and I, having nothing better to do, look around the shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
I don't know if it's dust or whatever, but the atmosphere in here is kind of stagnant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE4)
The shop is filled with CRTs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
The way they're all over the place makes them seem like trash, but according to Mr Braun, all of them work and are up for sale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCE)
The CRTs here are many and varied. There are remnants of the Shouwa era, flat types, and even HD CRTs which came out just before LCD TVs became popular.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAC)
【倫太郎】
Today you're open 'till late, huh? Normally, you close up just before 7PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
The amount of people in Akiba rapidly decreases as night gets closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
The major electronics shops all close up at about 8 or 9PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
At that time, as if the liveliness of the noon was only a lie, the area becomes completely silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
【天王寺】
A guest is coming over today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
【倫太郎】
Guest? The usual little beast?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E20)
【天王寺】
You... Don't you dare call my beloved daughter a 'little beast'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3A)
After glaring at me, the shopkeeper takes out a single photo from his breast pocket and gazes at it with affection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4A)
On the photo, there's an elementary school girl doing a peace sign while showing signs of embarrassment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E5A)
People who don't know the details might think that this muscleheaded middle-aged man is a perverted lolicon, but the girl in the photo is his real daughter. I think she's now in the 6th year of elementary school.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6A)
She's the second thing that this old man loves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7A)
I forgot her name, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8A)
She occasionally comes to this workshop to play around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA4)
【天王寺】
If you touch Nae, I'm going to kill you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB4)
Oh right, she's Sister Tennouji Braun Nae ... What a rare name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC4)
We, the dwellers of the 2nd floor, interacted with her a bit during the times that she came to play here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED4)
By 'dwellers', I obviously mean Mayuri, who became good friends with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE4)
Apparently, she's afraid of me and Daru, so she doesn't really approach us much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
Feeling my aura of insanity at that age. She sure is a promising little girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0E)
The shopkeeper faces the photo with his daughter on it, and gives it an exaggerated kiss.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1E)
That's slightly unpleasant...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F32)
【倫太郎】
But, has there really been any guests here besides your daughter?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F42)
I've been using the lab for about half a year now, and I barely saw any customers come in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F52)
This place obviously isn't profitable. Hell, it would be strange if it actually was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6C)
【天王寺】
A 'guest', or a client, or how should I put it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7C)
Putting back the photo and giving me an unclear answer, he returns to checking out the TV's condition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F96)
【天王寺】
Hmm, this is probably just an unsteady solder in the board. I can fix this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA6)
【倫太郎】
Really? Then please do so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB6)
【天王寺】
Wait. I didn't give you the price yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC6)
【倫太郎】
Wha-!? You're charging money?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE0)
【天王寺】
Obviously. Did you think that you wouldn't have to pay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF0)
【倫太郎】
You're the one who gave us this TV!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001000)
【天王寺】
So what? I never told you that you'd get free after-sales service.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001010)
【倫太郎】
Damn you... Saying that after giving me a half-broken product...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001020)
【天王寺】
Oh, shut up. If you don't want it, then I'll take it. I think I can get some money for it from recycling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001030)
【倫太郎】
That's oppression! How dare you do this to the man who can change the course of history!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104A)
【天王寺】
Huh? Who are you talkin 'bout?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105A)
【倫太郎】
Myself, of course!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001074)
【天王寺】
Brush your teeth and go to sleep, brat... Though, you sure have some guts, saying stuff like that to ME, who is letting you live on the 2nd floor here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001084)
【倫太郎】
Uh, I'll pay the repair fees, Mr Braun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001094)
At the end of the day, I am no match to him as I am right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B0)
At that moment, I hear the sound of the door opening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
When I look at that direction, I see a single female guest entering the shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001196)
It's a woman with long and slender limbs which make her look like an athlete. She's wearing a jersey and spats that emphasize the muscles on her thighs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
【鈴羽？】
O-haaaa!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
【倫太郎】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001218)
【天王寺】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
I feel as if someone just invoked the <DICT> Stand</DICT> of 'Za Warudo'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124C)
I really want to speak about what just happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
【鈴羽？】
Uh... huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
As the woman makes a circle with her thumbs and index fingers, she becomes flustered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001286)
This greeting had tremendous amounts of popularity when some male idol was using it during the time when I was a kid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
Personally, I believe that the originator of this was some veteran voice actor from a morning program on TouTele, but it's still very old...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A6)
Is this woman the 'guest' that was supposed to come?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B6)
Maybe she's just an acquaintance of his.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C6)
Could she be a daughter born of a different mother than the 'usual little beast'?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D6)
Or perhaps a lover?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E6)
She finally stops doing the 'o-haaaa' pose and clears her throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001300)
【鈴羽２】
Uhmm... I'm Amane, the one who called you earlier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001310)
And so, time begins to move again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
【天王寺】
You're the one who wants an interview for a part-time job here, right? I am Tennouji, the shopkeeper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
【倫太郎】
Part-time job interview!? This young female!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
【倫太郎】
You're telling me that the depressing, unfashionable and unprofitable CRT Workshop owned by a filthy old man actually has a chance of having a part-time worker--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
【天王寺】
You brat, do you want to pay 1000 extra yen starting next month?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
【倫太郎】
... I speak nothing but the truth. Though, I don't think that this is that I should be telling outsiders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
【倫太郎】
I had no idea that this shop takes part-time jobber applications, and with all the free time they'd get, I honestly don't see the need for them, either...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
【鈴羽２】
Ah, actually, I'm the one who asked for this job over the phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001424)
Awkwardly, the woman says that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001434)
【鈴羽２】
He refused at first, but after some pleading, he let me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001444)
Now that is truly surprising.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145E)
【天王寺】
Looks like we have some weird youth nowadays. Well, sit down on that chair, young lady.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146E)
【鈴羽２】
Oh, thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DA)
I thought of getting out, since it looks like an interview is about to start here, but I decided to hang around a bit, since he's not telling me to leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EA)
The woman has a stiff facial expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014FA)
Looks like she's nervous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150A)
Just because of an interview?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
As opposed to the expression she had when she said that she's the one who asked for the job, now she isn't showing much passion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152A)
【天王寺】
So, your name is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153A)
【鈴羽２】
Amane Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154A)
【天王寺】
Age?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155A)
【鈴羽２】
18
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156A)
Just like me, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157A)
【天王寺】
Student?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158A)
【鈴羽２】
No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159A)
She shakes her head to the sides.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AA)
A freeter, eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BA)
【天王寺】
Why do you want to work here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CA)
【鈴羽】
Because I love CRTs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DA)
【天王寺】
Accepted! Come to work starting tomorrow!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
【倫太郎】
Wait, that's all? Is this some sort of play? A preparation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
【鈴羽】
... Thank you, manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
The woman called Amane Suzuha breathes a sigh of relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
Then, she looks at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
【鈴羽】
So, you are?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
【倫太郎】
You want to... Know my name? No, give up on that. If I told you, terrible things would befall you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
【倫太郎】
There are too many people who were targeted by the Organization just because they knew my name. Sara from America, Claudia from Italy, Simone from France... I can't put anyone else in danger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B2)
【天王寺】
Hey, stop with the retarded delusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C2)
Kuh. I've been interrupted by emotionless words...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D2)
【天王寺】
This idiot is Okabe Rintaro, who's renting the 2nd floor here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E2)
The manager introduces me in my stead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F2)
【倫太郎】
It's not 'Okabe', I am Hououin--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
【天王寺】
Shut up, or I'll add extra 1000 yen to your rent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
【倫太郎】
... I'm Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
The woman stands up, puts her arm on my shoulder and looks at me with a serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
【鈴羽】
I don't know about this 'Organization' that you're being chased by, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
【鈴羽】
If you have any problems, Okabe Rintaro, you can always talk to me about it. I'm already used to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
【倫太郎】
... Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【天王寺】
...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F4)
She's already used to what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
【鈴羽】
Depending on what it is, I might also have to give you a good shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
【倫太郎】
Mr Braun, I don't think that you should accept her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001838)
【天王寺】
Yeah, it's dangerous. I'll fire her if she causes a disturbance. Also, the 'Organization' or whatever is something that Okabe made up, so don't take it seriously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001848)
【鈴羽】
Made up...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
【倫太郎】
You can just keep thinking that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
However, the world will one day bow before me... Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001884)
And so, Amane Suzuha stares at me again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001894)
Does she have a habit of looking people in the eyes, or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AE)
【鈴羽】
So this is what's popular today. I'll keep that in mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BE)
I really doubt that it's popular...
<FILEEND36>
