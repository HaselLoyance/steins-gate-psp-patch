Only interested in lines that start with "#mes" and not ("messWindowCloseWait")

Work with entire lines:
#mes is what Rintaro thinks
#mes2v is when someone is speaking

#mes I turn the TV off and go next to the sofa.%p
Message begins right after "#mes " and ends at "%p"

#mes2v OKA_0102,$W(LR_LIP_OKA),VID_OKA,＠Rintaro＠「Hey you there. Can you see us?」%p
Name begins at: ",＠" ends at: "＠「"
Message begins at: "＠「" ends at:"」%p"


TODO: Don't put newlines before <LINE> if previous one was <LINE>

For BIN files that have automatic translation (basically story strings) I'll bypass the atlas-compile step and will write final BINs in the topographer itself





DATA.txt has phone messages in it


DICT file structure is related to Game-Database.plist We can get translations for all the terms there.
&cTIPSC; == <DICT>
&cMESC; == </DICT>

Theory on how to display English character names in the appropriate "name box" on top of the main dialogue box:
-The game probably has some kind of the mapping file that if it detects a specific occurance 【<name in glyphs>】 that it will put it in the special box
- Do more research on this and if needed it can just be replaced with English string for the name
-Yeah, looks like they are in the DATA.txt. Good good
