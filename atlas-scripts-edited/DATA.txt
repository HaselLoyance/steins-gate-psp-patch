Okabe-san, I mailed you as soon as I could. My name is Kiryuu Moeka. I'm a 20 year old freelancer. I believe I mentioned I worked part time at a publishing company. Sorry for suddenly taking your picture. I didn't do it out of ill will. I needed some shots of Akihabara Town scenery for the publishing company, and indiscriminately took a picture without any particular target. Since the whole satellite thing happened, it actually was my ulterior motive to scoop out the right angle to shoot it, though (lmao). By the way, that picture I took was just a test, not the final shot. That's why I was just using the camera on my phone. Even if you weren't so franticly asking me to please delete it, it's not like I was really going to use it in an article.\n
\n
Well, now for the real issue. I'm really sorry for rudely asking a favor like this, Okabe-kun, but it would be super neato if I could ask your acquaintance, the super hacker, about the urban legend. Actually, I don't really know much about the PC, the IBN 5100, like what sorta PC it could be or anything at all. (All I have to rely on is that picture I showed you, Okabe-kun. Ah, I'll attach the image) Be absolutely, positively sure to reply okay? Because I'll be waiting. If you could, I'd be super happy if you gave me your super hacker friend's address. I'll mail you again. It's okay to mail you again, right? If it's not, then just tell me, okeydokies♪? Moeka

So I unintentionally relied on you. I swear I won't send any more short mails, so please don't abandon me. I want you to help me look for an IBN 5100. If I find out anything, I'll inform you too. Let's work together. Moeka

M4, you really don't seem good at social interaction. But that's just your personality. Besides, you're talking with me perfectly fine, aren't you? Honestly speaking, M4, there's nobody else who works quite as hard as you do. I'm very thankful for that. I'm glad you joined the Rounders. Even if nobody else values you, I'll always look out for you. Feel free to casually mail me like this.\n
\n
Oh yes, since you're finally in Nagoya, you should at least try some of the local specialties. It's not good for your health to keep eating convenience store onigiri. Or are you not good with Nagoya's miso culture, M4? Even so, you should at least eat something at your age. I guess I'd recommend the firm miso stew.\n
\n
Your next mission is to go to Akihabara, Tokyo, so look for an apartment to live in by next week. 'Cause we're giving you a special bonus payment, okay?\n
\n
Well, see you.\n

If what you wrote in your mail is all true, then it's very interesting indeed. Particularly concerning the IBN 5100's hidden ability, which I have not mentioned to anybody as of yet. I am indeed surprised at the fact that you know about it. However, I have not gone to the year 2000. Though, there is a possibility I may go there after this. There are three possibilities:\n
\n
First, the possibility that the John Titor who appeared in 2000 is my future self. In other words, I who have returned to 2010, will go to 2000 from here, and write about the things you have told me. But that would cause an a chicken and egg paradox, wouldn't it.\n
\n
Second, it's all your delusion, or possibly, fabrication. But for the sake of serious discussion of your statements, let's leave this possibility behind.\n
\n
Third. There is a possibility that you saw something I wrote in a different world line. Basically, that means that 10 years ago, you existed in a different world line than the world line we're at now. However, that explanation brings out an impossibility. When the world line changes, every cause and effect is reconstructed from past to future in order to prevent paradoxes. That theory was proven in 2036. So, essentially, it's not expected for "memories of another world line" to ever remained unchanged. Not even for time travelers like me... Do you have any knowledge on this point?

That's very, very interesting. Just judging by the phenomenon you described, I would say what you accomplished is indeed changing the past. I suspect that the mail you sent into the past changed the world line's divergence, if just a little. BRAVO! The instant your mail arrived in the past, I think you were moved from your original world line to an ever-so-slightly different one. In this world line, the world's supposed past became this: you learned the Lotto6 winning numbers from a mail you got from your future self, told your friend the numbers, and your friend mistook a number upon buying the ticket. So the mail probably disappeared from your sent history when the world line changed. But the only point I don't get is why you still have memories from before the past was changed. I just want to get things straight, but this is the truth, right?

Strictly speaking, it's a little misleading when I wrote that the world follows the Everett Wheeler model. More theories that were developed based off of it were popularized. In the two years following 2034, when the time machine was completed,discussion over world explanations progressed dramatically. In 2036, it was clarified that the world was constructed of things called "Attractor Fields", which describe the extent of world line convergence. This theory was originally hypothesized in 2020.

Sorry, I forgot to mention the divergence numbers. I have a personal meter that measures them. My original world line in 2036 was calibrated to be 0％. It is, after all, a subjective, relative measurement, not an absolute. In the end, this tool can only indicate the "current" divergence.

Attractor Fields are, simply put, the focal points of world line convergence. They can also be used to explain things once called "fate" or "chance". There is no real meaning to making small changes to the world line. Small changes result in the same conclusion due to convergence. And humans who can observe that convergence rarely exist. I haven't met anybody who holds that sort of ability, so I'm qualified to accurately judge but... Kyouma, you could possibly be that rare existence who holds that ability. You might be able to guide the world. To the world line beyond 1％ divergence. Beyond the Attractor Field wall.

Faris and I are currently hiding above "Ramen Tasaburou". It's mostly empty with some sacks of wheat flour. Nothing that looks useful as a weapon, and nothing big enough to hide behind. The Viral Attackers are chasing us. It's not a place that seems like you can hear people talking. I wouldn't have a problem taking on one or ten guys, but Faris is here, so I can't just go crazy. Daru, please call us a taxi.

RaiNet Kakeru ■ Access No. 1\n
"The rumored guy is no good!? Mystery Transfer Student"\n
\n
NY net cafe. Someone types a mail.\n
"In an hour, start the cyber attack against the Department of Defense..."\n
\n
Yumehara Kakeru, a fifth grader who just recently transferred to\n
Kaigyou Elementary. Flawless in study and sport, but doesn't\n
particularly stand out.\n
\n
His classmates, Kirari and Tamaru, are members of the school's\n
small computer club, and try to get Kakeru to join with the\n
reasoning that they need anybody to increase their numbers.\n
But Kakeru wasn't personally interested.\n
\n
【Kirari】\n
「He's probably not good with computers. It can't be helped.」\n
\n
Then one day, during computer class.\n
Quickly touch typing, Tamaru boasts to Kakeru. While rebuking\n
Tamaru for that, Kirari shows off her abundant knowledge of\n
computers and the internet.\n
\n
【Tamaru】\n
「Hey, Kirari, look at the transfer student. He's only using one finger\n
to type-」\n
\n
【Kirari】\n
「Come on, stop that, Tamaru. He's just a transfer student, so he\n
can't help it, can he?」\n
\n
Everyone in the class looked down on Kakeru's lack of ability\n
when they saw him slowly press keys one by one, as if he were\n
confirming each individual keystroke.\n
\n
It was that moment. Something groaned from within Kakeru's bag.\n
Attracting everyone's attention, a sub notebook PC that would\n
make anyone in school jealous appeared.\n
Moreover, it had a unique shape.\n
\n
【Tamaru】\n
「This guy can't be for real! A sub notebook even though he types\n
one-fingered!?」\n
\n
【Kirari】\n
「That's not it, Tamaru. Look, that sub notebook doesn't have a\n
display」\n
\n
【Tamaru】\n
「Ki-Kirari~, I've never seen anything like that~, it's making a\n
screen!」\n
\n
The "Upa" inside Kakeru's sub notebook carried an emergency\n
mail from Nagaya-san. Written in the mail was the surprising news\n
that the Department of Defense had been hacked.\n
\n
Upon confirming the contents of the mail, Kakeru's eye color\n
\n
changes, and his movements accelerate to a surprising rate.\n
The entire class stared blankly. He removes the screen from the\n
special sub notebook and connects the keyboard to a school\n
computer.\n
As emergency countermeasures, he uses the school computer to\n
begin pursuit of the cracker. Kirari and Tamaru are astonished\n
when Kakeru starts operating the keyboard with violent force.\n
Kakeru pursues the traces of the cracker who hides his identity by\n
using servers throughout the world. Easily exterminating trap\n
viruses and such, he draws close to his opponent.\n
NY net cafe. A window opens on the monitor.\n
Kakeru finally corners the culprit. Faster than cyber police units\n
throughout the world, and the CIA, Kakeru reaches the culprit's\n
computer and accosts him through chat.\n
\n
The culprit called himself "J". J releases viruses. Those are\n
powerful things, which have the power to force other people's\n
computers to freeze.\n
But Kakeru defends himself by shooting a precise vaccine, slowly\n
approaching the culprit's whereabouts. The location was found to\n
be somewhere in NY. After just a few moments, he'll have the\n
specific address...\n
J is surprised by Kakeru's ability again. "I never thought I'd have to\n
use this..." he says as he takes out a strangely shaped CD-ROM.\n
Kakeru could not defend against the virus released from that CD-\n
ROM. Furthermore, all of the computers in the classroom are\n
destroyed by that mystery program attack.\n
\n
It was Kakeru's complete defeat--\n
The computer room teacher's face reddens with rage. At that time,\n
the school dismissal bell rings. While feeling regret, Kakeru\n
rollerblades to where Nagaya-san is.\n
\n
Kirari and Tamaru, wanting to know what sort of person Kakeru,\n
the transfer student is, chase after him.\n
Nagaya-san tells him that the computer virus J used is the very\n
dangerous Monster Program "Vaios".\n
\n
The mystery Monster Programs made for an unknown purpose.\n
\n
Their destructive force is said to be thousands of times stronger\n
than normal viruses. There are 9 types of these unreproducible\n
Monster Programs. It is said that he who collects all of them can\n
control the entire internet world--\n
Simply put, this Monster Program is legendary on the internet.\n
And a hacker has appeared who can use it.\n
This is a global state of emergency.\n
\n
「What should we do!?」\n
As Kakeru implores this, Nagaya-san takes out a gaudy-looking\n
input card.\n
「We're not just going to stand here and watch. We're just about\n
finished developing a new RaiNet Card.」\n
\n
Just what is this new RaiNet Card?\n
And what is Kakeru's true identity?\n
\n
Meanwhile--\n
The NY net cafe's door opens, and out comes a pretty boy.\n
「Kakeru, huh... what an interesting guy」\n
While putting away a strangely shaped CD-ROM, he laughs like\n
he's enjoying himself.\n
\n
That boy is the elementary hacker who shook the world in the past-\n
"J"--\n

"Now to the future! RaiNet Formation!"\n
\n
Completely engrossed by the talk, Kirari and Tamaru raise their\n
voices.\n
\n
「Just what sort of person is Kakeru?」\n
\n
Kakeru was actually one who protects the order of the internet:\n
A Net Guardian.\n
Kirari and Tamaru wanted to tell their friends how cool that was.\n
But Kakeru clearly forbade them due to the risk that he may have\n
to fight with the culprit.\n
At that time, they received news that the mystery hacker "Beesman"\n
had attacked an online game server. Kakeru immediately challenges\n
him using Nagaya-san's newly made RaiNet Card and the unique\n
Browser Alpha Gate.\n
\n
The first use of a new RaiNet Card. Even with that handicap,\n
Kakeru successfully cast his Boot Spell.\n
Just when Kakeru thought he had easily won against the cracker,\n
Beesman, who had complete control of the game server, overwrites\n
the game program system, sealing Kakeru deep within the game's\n
loop dungeon.\n
Kakeru is in danger.\n
At that moment, somehow Kirari and Tamaru also Server Dive.\n
They came to save Kakeru!\n
Furthermore, these two are well versed in this game.\n
As game players, they were in pain, and couldn't just silently\n
watch. The two of them absolutely couldn't forgive the hacker who\n
had taken over the server and toyed with the game players, and\n
decided to join forces with Kakeru.\n
With their magnificent assistance, and Kakeru's shoot ability,\n
they successfully defeated Beesman.\n
\n
And when they did, suddenly an unknown chat window opens on\n
\n
It was a signal from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.\n
「By any chance, are they here to praise us?」they thought in\n
delight, but...\n
The police turned to them, and said--\n
\n
「You're under arrest!」\n
<END2>

"Pi-po-pi-po-! The Net Police Trap!"\n
\n
Japan's Net Police did not think well of Kakeru, who had kept\n
doing meritorious deeds. They threatened to persecute Kakeru\n
under the Unauthorized Access laws. They didn't ask the crime this\n
time, but left a message for them to restrain themselves, taking\n
credit for Beesman's arrest.\n
「What can children do?」ridiculed Red, a member of the Net Police.\n
This angered Kakeru and the others. They had no intention to lose\n
in hacking skill.\n
\n
And then, saying「Listen to the whole story!」Pi-po-kun's icon\n
made an appearance. Somehow, Pi-po-kun's icon was suggesting a\n
contest.\n
Cyber-crime wholeheartedly follows corruption. It's also a fact\n
that they want even a little war potential. However, that's no\n
reason to investigate powerless children. So, thus, he wanted to.\n
have a game to test Kakeru and friends' ability.\n
Kakeru and friends would win if they could infiltrate the deepest\n
part of the Metropolitan Police Department's server where Pi-po-\n
kun lies. If they could prevent that, it would be the Net Police's\n
win. If Kakeru and friends won, they would be granted the arrest\n
privileges equal to the Net Police-- This was Pi-po-kun's proposal.\n
Thinking himself unbeatable, Red agreed to the contest.\n
Thus, the Metropolitan Police Department's server became the stage\n
for the hacking battle.\n
\n
But, in cowardice, Red closed every port to the server. Ports, are,\n
so to speak, doors that open to the outside. In other words, it was\n
like penetrating a building without entrances.\n
Without a foundation, Kakeru and friends were at a loss. However,\n
an idea floated to Kakeru. He would rollerblade through the town\n
with Kirari and Tamaru.\n
Receiving their cooperation, Kakeru successfully infiltrated the\n
Department building. Attaching his sub notebook through their\n
public phone, with abundant knowledge and splendid technique,\n
he steadily heads to the depths, successfully reaching the server!\n
\n
Pi-po-kun magnificently declares Kakeru's win. As promised, they\n
later complete backing from the police. Kakeru and friends are\n
overjoyed. However, Red protests「What authority does Pi-po-kun\n
have to do that!? This is invalid!」\n
\n
At that time, a window opened in front of Pi-po-kun. And there,\n
within the window, was the Superintendent General. In other words,\n
he was Pi-po-kun's true identity all along!\n
When he said "Isn't youthful power like theirs necessary... to fight\n
against cyber-crime?" Red was unable to object.\n
\n
And thus, the police sanctioned "RaiNet Guardians" were born!\n

"Computer Club Head Kazuma's pride"\n
\n
Kirari and Tamaru implored Kakeru to join the Computer Club.\n
But the head of the Computer Club, Ichikawa Kazuma, from class\n
4 said「Unless I see Kakeru's true skill, I won't recognize his entry\n
to the club!」.\n
And then, a written challenge appeared from Shidou Elementary's\n
computer. Shidou is a rival school competing in the typing\n
tournament "Typing Masters".\n
There was no way they could turn down the challenge. And so the\n
Typing Battle Game between Kazuma and the Shidou Computer\n
Club Head, "Ima Pyuuta" began.\n
At first, Kazuma was dominating with a steady score. However,\n
his opponent, taking advantage of the fact that he cannot be seen in\n
an online battle, underhandedly sends a virus program to Kaigyou\n
Elementary's PC, slowing down its processing speed.\n
\n
And, without him noticing it at all, Kazuma starts losing. Kakeru,\n
having noticed the opponent cheating with a dirty virus, suggests\n
to switch places.\n
\n
【Kazuma】\n
「The honor of Kaigyou Elementary hangs on this fight. I'm not just\n
going to switch places with you.」\n
\n
But, Kazuma was too proud. The match was gradually turning\n
against him.\n
At this point, Tamaru and Kirari start pressuring Kazuma to listen\n
to Kakeru. The whole class holds their breath as the baton is\n
passed to Kakeru during devastating circumstances.\n
Kazuma has already given up. He bows his head and turns his back.\n
But from behind his back, comes the sound of typing unlike any\n
he's ever heard before.\n
Kazuma looks back in surprise upon hearing a sound reverberate\n
like a machine. There was the Kakeru, crushing the opponent with\n
a frontal attack, typing with a godlike speed!\n
And then a splendid victory!\n
Kazuma clung onto Kakeru in an embrace, exclaiming「Please join\n
our Computer Club!」.\n
\n
And then Nagaya-san called. An online bank cracking incident had\n
occurred! The enemy is the internationally renowned bank robber,\n
"Bishop!" Tension once again runs through Kakeru and friends!\n

"Encounter with Bishop, online bank hacker"\n
\n
Online banking has become common knowledge.\n
Wireless transmissions occasionally\n
transfer billions of currency units.\n
\n
The current enemy, "Bishop" is a tough\n
opponent, cracking through mobile net\n
while driving to mask his location.\n
But Kakeru predicts his opponent's\n
movements, one by one, gradually cornering\n
him. In order to close the distance,\n
Kakeru and friends don rollerblades, moving\n
to hotspots and public phone lines in town!\n
With Kakeru's quick technique and precise\n
strikes, along with Tamaru's group's team-\n
work, they successfully corner Bishop!\n
Cornered, Bishop uses his last resort!\n
One of the 9 existing phantom Monster\n
Programs, "Terios!"\n
Its irrational destruction ability instantly\n
turns the tables on Kakeru. Using Terios,\n
Bishop prepares the finishing blow.\n
The vile virus approaches!\n
\n
Checkmate for Kakeru!! --but then, as if\n
to protect them, something flies out of...\n

"To the trial, upaupa! Upa's secret"\n
\n
Upa had taken a direct attack from the\n
Monster-level virus.\n
But he was left unscathed. And of all\n
things, he ate the attack itself.\n
Kakeru successfully countered Bishop with\n
Upa's great efforts. Additionally, he\n
got Bishop's Monster Program "Terios".\n
But he didn't understand. Why could Upa\n
eat such a strong Monster-level virus\n
program?\n
\n
Not even Nagaya-san knew. But the mystery\n
Site Master "Cyber Dragon", might know.\n
\n
Cyber Dragon, who had information about\n
every program in existence, seemed like an\n
elder who knew the entire net world.\n
Kakeru and friends search for Cyber\n
Dragon's site immediately.\n
\n
In order to get the URL for Cyber Dragon's\n
site, it seems they must clear the online\n
game called "Cyber Dragon Trial".\n
It was a typing battle with increasing\n
viral attacks, wearing Kakeru down.\n
But he keeps going with his friends'\n
encouragement. After struggling, Kakeru\n
successfully gets Cyber Dragon's URL.\n
They were able to meet him.\n
\n
As his name suggests, his form is an elder\n
dragon. He looks at Upa's program.\n
And what he understood was that Upa was\n
also a Monster Program.\n
Kirari worries Upa is dangerous. But\n
Cyber Dragon says a deadly weapon can be\n
used to protect if the user wills it.\n
But that also means it would be necessary\n
to awaken Upa's inner Monster Program.\n
But if Kakeru doesn't fully understand, the\n
awakened form will be impossible to control.\n
Without knowing how to awaken Upa, Kakeru\n
and friends leave Cyber Dragon's site.\n
To conquer vile programs, Kakeru vows to\n
one day find Upa's Monster Program\n
activation process--\n

Before long, rumors spread around the world\n
of Kakeru and friends, the super elementary...\n

"First in aircraft history! Ground hijack!"\n
\n
To participate in the worldwide Typing Masters\n
in America, Japan's team will go to LA.\n
Among Japan's reps is Kakeru, who became an\n
instant celebrity for solving numerous crimes.\n
Tamaru accompanies as second, and Kirari pays\n
her own way with her rich girl power. They\n
were chatting when an incident occurred.\n
\n
The frantic cabin crew came to them. It\n
seems that the jumbo jet has been hijacked.\n
Moreover, the culprit was not onboard, but\n
apparently hijacked the CPU from the ground.\n
The crew could not switch to manual control,\n
letting the hacker decrease the plane's\n
altitude along with its 276 passengers.\n
The culprit used not one explosive, but\n
circuits to halt the jet engines, which\n
would cause the plane to crash: this\n
century's first "Ground Hijack!"\n
He wanted the Monster Program "Upa".\n
Kakeru infiltrates the jet with his sub notebook\n
and tries to find the culprit's path, but can't.\n
The only line that connects to the jet is\n
the heavily password-protected control tower's.\n
Searching for the core of that line... fails.\n
There is no suspicious activity from the tower.\n
Kakeru and friends grow impatient.\n
\n
Only special radio waves should have been able\n
to reach the plane's height from the tower.\n
But Kakeru considers other possibilities and\n
thinks of one way: via satellite.\n
"Bingo!" Kakeru was right. The ground base\n
connected to the satellite by a foreign line.\n
The culprit broke the satellite's firewall to\n
connect to the plane CPU. Both a satellite\n
and a plane were hijacked in this major\n
incident.\n
Kakeru figures this out and corners the\n
culprit. The first war fought at the core of\n
an orbiting satellite begins. A quick victory.\n
The opponent was clever, but not enough to\n
match Kakeru's operation. Kakeru and friends\n
watch the first star war unfold on screen.\n
The jumbo jet was almost as beautiful as a\n
space shuttle. Floating in space. Stars\n
shone in Kakeru's eyes.\n
\n
At last, the global Typing Masters begins.\n

\n
Despite the incident, they safely arrive at\n
the LA airport. Exiting the crowded terminal,\n
they express concern for an American youth\n
\n
【Tamaru】\n
「Heh, so Americans are fine people too-」\n
\n
【Kirari】\n
「Considerate people live in every country.」\n
\n
30 minutes from airport by bus. They arrive\n
at the LA convention center.\n
An aura of feverish competition spreads\n
through the Typing Master grounds.\n
Most surprisingly, the participant list\n
includes world famous hackers and crackers.\n
Since they leave no evidence, they evade\n
wanted lists.\n
And within is the name of the fated opponent,\n
"J". They have not yet met personally.\n
\n
【Tamaru】\n
「I bet he looks like a scoundrel.」\n
\n
The battles are live-streamed worldwide on\n
the internet, grasping the same attention\n
as the Olympics.\n
The tournament starts the main race. An\n
energetic DJ announces the top 8. 7th\n
called is Kakeru, and last is "J's" name.\n
That last face... is the face of the boy who\n
helped the lady in the airport!\n
The 3 are shocked. Who is he? Also, Kakeru\n
is the last Japanese rep remaining. Another\n
one, Red's subordinate, lost first round.\n
They can only watch over Kakeru.\n
Kakeru's first best 8 opponent is the\n
rhythmic Dancing Typist "Lost Shade",\n
who was no match for Kakeru's speed and\n
completely lost.\n
Kakeru advances. His next opponent is\n
"Indra Panther" son of an Arabian oil baron.\n
Using limber yoga movements, he appeared\n
jointless. It was a hard match since his\n
movement patterns left no openings.\n
But Kakeru used a freezing virus attack,\n
sealing his opponent's moves. Finally, one\n

How will this match turn out...!?\n

"Decisive battle! And... beginning"\n
\n
J's weapon could be called "Bunshin no\n
jutsu". His quick motions gave the\n
His self-taught typing method was\n
nicknamed "Cross Ripper". J is fairly\n
famous in America's underground world,\n
and many imitate this style.\n
It gets its name from the motif of crossing\n
arms into a cruciform shape.\n
Of course, Kakeru also has a unique skill,\n
nicknamed "Thunder Gladiator".\n
Enough typing speed causes friction\n
between finger and key, bringing forth a small\n
electric current like lightning from his\n
fingertips, gradually building up.\n
They were evenly matched. First set went\n
to Kakeru, second to J: the match hinged\n
on the final round.\n
Final match. Sparks flew in this grand head-\n
to-head fight. The struggle was projected\n
onto large display panels. The audience\n
held their breath. But the match was\n
interrupted by a power outage.\n
It wasn't normal trouble. Normally, the UPS\n
(Uninterruptible Power Supply) would\n
activate, and the machines would not fail.\n
An inevitable, temporary truce. The sponsor\n
gathered the confused audience.\n
...Then, every display projected a\n
suspicious logo, and words slowly\n
appeared letter by letter.\n
\n
「I_am_a_Monster. _You_are_friend?\n
hahahaha」\n
\n
Along with the ominous message, tiny\n
electronic sounds could be heard.\n
\n
【J】\n
「Kakeru! Move!」\n
\n
J suddenly pushes Kakeru and forcibly unplugs\n
Kakeru's keyboard from the tourney PC.\n
As soon as he does, sparks fly from the\n
USB port...\n
His ever-important player keyboard\n
narrowly avoids shorting. It seems like\n
J saved Kakeru.\n
\n
【Kakeru】\n
「Th-thanks」\n
\n
【J】\n
「Hmph, don't thank me. I just can't have\n
a match without an opponent.」\n
\n
Leaving those words, J goes away.\n
Though the finals over and wins equal, J\n
disappeared without accepting their trophy.\n
Of course, Kakeru also refused it. And so\n
the match will be saved for next year.\n
\n
Mystery boy J. Kakeru and friends were\n
unaware that after that, J also possessed\n
a RaiNet badge.\n

“Whose girl is that girl? Tamaru's love story“\n
\n
Kakeru and friends eliminate crackers again\n
today. Tamaru meets the no. 1 girl on the\n
net. He can't help but notice Ayumi, who\n
gives off an awfully sad aura.\n
Tamaru makes up his mind to find Ayumi's\n
site and is shocked. It's been ravaged by\n
trolls. Her password was cracked, so she\n
can't even close the site.\n
Investigating, he finds it was a low level\n
prank by an unspecified amount of script\n
kiddies using a cracking tool available\n
Enraged, Tamaru challenges the kiddies to\n
a match. Tamaru disregards Kakeru's\n
warnings, recklessly plunging headfirst.\n
As a result, he suffers danger, but\n
perseveres, eventually beating the kiddies\n
and restoring Ayumi's site.\n
Tamaru goes to tell her it's safe now.\n
But traumatized Ayumi is too scared of\n
the net to restart her site, and doesn't\n
return his feelings. Tamaru was at a loss\n
for words.\n
\n
But--\n
People around the world who knew the\n
situation send encouraging mails to Ayumi.\n
The internet is not just made of malice.\n
There is also unconditional kindness.\n
Ayumi decides to reopen her site. And they\n
find out she also attends Kaigyou.\n
The two of them meet once. Who appears in\n
front of the nervously waiting Tamaru is\n
a boy. Ayumi was a Guy In Real Life.\n
\n
And thus, Tamaru's love(?) splendidly\n
was in spite of myself.\n

J starts another cyberterror incident.\n
Kakeru chases but is repelled by the enemy.\n
He and his friends are program frozen by\n

With them in that state, J talks to Kakeru.\n

「Kakeru, why do you try to stop me?」\n
\n
【Kakeru】\n
「Why are you doing this!? Is suffering\n
really that fun for you!?」\n
\n
J answered he was testing his own power.\n
To see if he could break the unbreakable,\n
steal the unstealable. Testing oneself...\n
is that not also why Kakeru is a Net\n
Guardian?\n
Kakeru says that's not true. J leaves\n
while saying Kakeru's not being honest.\n
Kakeru begins to waver with J's words,\n
wondering why he became a Net Guardian. He\n
wanted to make use of his genius knowledge\n
and technique handed down by his father.\n
He didn't gain power to become a Guardian.\n
\n
【Kakeru】\n
「Have I been a Guardian just to test my\n
own power...?」\n

Kakeru is troubled. Sitting in front of his\n
computer, he doubts his own heart.\n

Accidents happen all over. While tragic news-\n

【Kakeru's Father】\n
「Never sink to underhanded techniques.\n
True strength is in the cards.」\n

The way to awaken Upa is to seal the\n
entirety of his program into a RaiNet Card,\n
producing an attack card.\n
Since taking Upa out of the computer\n
means uninstalling (killing) him, Kakeru\n
knows it's risky. But Operation Awaken\n
Upa is a huge success!\n
Upa's power increases beyond imagination.\n
Kakeru's overwhelming technique and Upa's\n

\T02時間は一方向には流れていないと言う事について, みなさんは特に何も感じなかったようですね。\n
\T02それが固定観念に支配されている証拠です。\n
\T02そしてその固定観念を破ろうとしないのは, 私の目から見るとかなり深刻です。\n
\T02ディストピアが構築されてしまった理由が何となく分かったような気がします。\n
\n
\n
\T02ダイバージェンスが変わるような大きな出来事が発生すると, その度に過去は因果律に沿って矛盾が無いよう再構成されます。\n
\T02例えば今, この世界線が, とある重大な出来事が発生した事でダイバージェンスが大きく変動し, 世界線Ｂへ移ったとします。\n
\T02世界線Ｂには, 残念ながらこの＠ちゃんねるというネット掲示板は存在していませんでした。\n
\T02その場合, あなたがたの中に有る『＠ちゃんねるを見た。\n
\T02書き込みをした』と言うこれまでの記憶は消去され, その時間に別の事をしていた記憶が構築されるのです。\n
\n
\T02これはつまり, 現在を変える事で過去も変わる事の証明です。\n
\n
\T02SERNについては昨日説明しました。あえて説明を付け加えるとするなら, 彼らの言う事を安易に信じてはならないと言う事です。\n
\T02既に彼らはマイクロブラックホール生成に成功しています。\n

\T04この装置によってミクロ特異点を発生させたり, 通過時の重力調整を行います。\n
\T04ミクロ特異点に電子を注入する事でそれは可能です。\n
\T04電子注入により特異点は超高速回転を始め局所重力正弦波が発生するのです。\n
\T04私は専門家では無いですので, 仕組みについてはこれ以上は適切な説明が出来ません。\n
\T04カー・ブラックホールは人工的に作る事が可能とだけ言っておきます。\n
\n
\T04SERNが2010年時点でブラックホール生成実験を行っている事についてはみなさんもご存じの筈です。\n

\T04移動先の指定はＶＧＬで行います\n
\T04ＶAｌｕAｂｌｅ ＧｒAｖｉｔｙ Ｌｏｃｋシステム\n
\T04日本語だと可変重力ロックシステムと言った所でしょうか\n
\T04重力歪曲装置とセットになっている物です\n
\T04これで到着予定先の局所重力を読み込み, ティプラー正弦波をその位置にロックするのです\n
\T04地球の重力を捉えるので, 必ず地球が有る場所に到着出来ます\n
\T044個のセシウム時計の光学システムを利用して計算している為, 誤差は極めて微少の物になります\n
